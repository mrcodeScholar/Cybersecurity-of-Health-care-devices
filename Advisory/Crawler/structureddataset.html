To reduce the risk associated with these vulnerabilities, BD recommends users implement the following mitigations and compensating controls: Provide appropriate network perimeter security, such as using firewalls, or create Access Control Lists (ACL) to limit network traffic from devices to only the required ports on the required endpoints. The PCU only requires access to DNS, dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) and SM on port 3613. The PCU does not accept unsolicited inbound traffic. BD recommends segmenting BD Alaris PCUs onto a separate virtual local area network (VLAN) to further enhance the security of BD Alaris PCUs. Users should control network access to the SM server image by restricting external access to only those addresses and ports indicated in Chapter 1 of the SM Virtual Machine Deployment Guide. Users should apply SSL certificates from valid Certificate Authorities, per Chapter 9 of the same document. Follow Chapter 1 of the Alaris System Maintenance Software User Manual to enable an authentication challenge password for network configuration changes. See the Network Settings section of the Alaris System Maintenance User Manual for details on how to manage these credentials. Network Settings in the Alaris System Maintenance User Manual details managing these credentials.Monitor network traffic for unusual or unexpected traffic and activity. If users suspect credentials have been exposed, change credentials immediately. Utilize MAC filtering on the network segment containing the BD Alaris System to restrict access to only those approved devices needed. Periodically inspect BD Alaris System components to ensure running the correct software versions. Use the instructions in Chapter 4 of the SM User Manual or Section 6.2.10 of the BD Alaris PCU and Pump Module Technical Service Manual to find software versions. Adhere to industry security best practices regarding access control, identification and authorization, personnel security, and physical protection of assets, as recommended by NIST SP 800-171 Rev. 2. Inspect the BD Alaris System prior to use for signs of tampering as indicated in the FIPS 140-2 Compliance Instructions for BD Alaris System Products Service Manual.

      <td>According to Baxter, software updates to disable Telnet and FTP (CVE-2022-26392) are in process. Software updates addressing the format string attack (CVE-2022-26393) are included in WBM version 20D30 and all other WBM versions authentication is already available in Spectrum IQ (CVE-2022-26394). Instructions to erase all data and settings on WBMs and pumps before decommissioning and transferring to other facilities (CVE-2022-26390) are in process for incorporation into the Spectrum Operator’s Manual. Baxter provides recommended steps for erasing all data and settings on the pump to be decommissioned: Reset the network settings (Biomed-&gt;Network Configuration-&gt;Transfer Network Settings-&gt;Reset).Delete the drug library.Clear the history log. To erase all data and settings on the WBM to be decommissioned: Select a pump other than the one last used with the WBM.Reset the network settings and enable networking on the pump.Place the WBM on the pump.Wait until the network icon turns yellow. In conjunction with the user’s own network security policies, Baxter recommends the following mitigations to reduce the likelihood these vulnerabilities will be exploited: Ensure appropriate physical controls within user environments to protect against unauthorized access to devices.Isolate the Spectrum Infusion Systems to its own network virtual local area network (VLAN) to segregate the system from other hospital systems and reduce the probability that a threat actor could execute an adjacent attack, such as a machine-in-the-middle attack against the system to observe clear-text communications.Use the strongest available wireless network security protocols (WPA2, EAP-TLS, etc.) to provide authentication/encryption of wireless data sent to/from the Spectrum Infusion System.Users should ensure the WBM is rebooted after configuration for their network(s) by removing the WBM from the rear of the Spectrum device for 10-15 seconds, and then re-attaching the WBM.Users should always monitor for and/or block unexpected traffic, such as FTP and Telnet, at network boundaries into the Spectrum-specific VLAN. As a last resort, users may disable wireless operation of the pump; the Spectrum Infusion System was designed to operate without network access. This action would impact an organization’s ability to rapidly deploy drug library (formulary) updates to their pumps. For additional information, see theBaxter Product Security Bulletin.

      <td>Baxter Healthcare has reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.</td>
      <td>Baxter recommends ensuring appropriate physical controls within user environments to protect against unauthorized access to devices. Baxter recommends isolating the Spectrum Infusion Systems to its own network VLAN to segregate the system from other hospital systems, and reduce the probability that a threat actor could execute an adjacent attack such as a MiTM attack against the system to observe clear-text communications. --------- Begin Update B Part 6 of 6 --------- Baxter recommends using the strongest available wireless network security protocols (e.g., WPA2, EAP-TLS, etc.) to provide authentication and encryption of wireless data sent to and from the Spectrum Infusion System. --------- End Update B Part 6 of 6 --------- Users should ensure the WBM is rebooted after configuration for their network(s) by removing the WBM from the rear of the Spectrum device for 10-15 seconds, and then re-attaching the WBM. Users should always monitor for and/or block unexpected traffic, such as FTP, at network boundaries into the Spectrum-specific VLAN. As a last resort, users may disable wireless operation of the pump. The Spectrum Infusion System was designed to operate without network access. This action would impact an organization’s ability to rapidly deploy drug library (formulary) updates to their pumps. For additional information please see theBaxter Product Security Bulletin. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should: Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they arenot accessible from the Internet.Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available.

      <td>Julian Suleder, Nils Emmerich, Birk Kauer of ERNW Research GmbH, Dr. Oliver Matula of ERNW Enno, and Rey Netzwerke GmbH reported these vulnerabilities to the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), Germany, in the context of the BSI project ManiMed (Manipulation of medical devices), which reported these to Philips.</td>
      <td>Note: To successfully exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to gain either physical access to surveillance stations and patient monitors or access to the medical device network. Philips released the following versions to remediate reported vulnerabilities: Patient Information Center iX (PICiX) Version C.03PerformanceBridge Focal PointIntelliVue Patient Monitors Versions N.00 and N.01IntelliVue Patient Monitors Version M.04: Contact aPhilips service support teamfor an upgrade pathCertificate revocation within the system was implemented for PIC iX and Performance Bridge FocalPoint in 2023. The implementation of the IntelliVue Patient Monitors will be completed in Q3 of 2024. As a mitigation to these vulnerabilities, Philips recommends the following: The Philips patient monitoring network is required to be physically or logically isolated from the hospital local area network (LAN). Philips recommends using a firewall or routers that can implement access control lists restricting access in and out of the patient monitoring network for only necessary ports and IP addresses. Refer to the Philips Patient Monitoring System Security for Clinical Networks guide for additional information onInCenter.By default, the simple certificate enrollment protocol (SCEP) service is not running. When needed, the service is configured to run based on the duration or the number of certificates to be assigned. One certificate is default, but if a certificate is not issued, the service will continue to run. Limit exposure by ensuring the SCEP service is not running unless it is actively being used to enroll new devices.When enrolling new devices using SCEP, enter a unique challenge password of 8-12 unpredictable and randomized digits.Implement physical security controls to prevent unauthorized login attempts on the PIC iX application. Servers should be kept in controlled locked data centers. Access to equipment at nurses' stations should be controlled and monitored.Only grant remote access to PIC iX servers on a must-have basis.Grant login privileges to the bedside monitor and PIC iX application on a role-based, least-privilege basis, and only to trusted users. Users with questions regarding their specific Philips Patient Information Center (PIC iX) and/or IntelliVue patient monitor installations and new release eligibility should contact their localPhilips service support team, or regional service support, or call 1-800-722-9377. Please see thePhilips product security websitefor the Philips advisory and the latest security information for Philips products. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities, such as: Implement physical security measures to limit or control access to critical systems.Restrict system access to authorized personnel only and follow a least privilege approach.Apply defense-in-depth strategies.Disable unnecessary accounts and services.Where additional information is needed, refer to existingcybersecurity in medical device guidance issued by the FDA.

BD recommends that users apply the following compensating controls: --------- Begin Update B Part 5 of 6 -------- BD recommends hospitals create dedicated medical device wireless networks that only house medical equipment with wireless cards. This could potentially reduce the impact to other devices on the hospital network.Users of the Alaris PC unit model 8015 should upgrade to the latest Alaris PC unit software to reduce associated risks.BD will address this vulnerability through an upcoming version of the BD Alaris PC Unit software, pending 510(k) clearance. --------- End Update B Part 5 of 6 -------- Users are advised to follow procedures for clearing wireless network authentication credentials on the Alaris PCU if the device is to be removed from service or it will not be in control of institutional staff. These procedures are outlined in the Alaris System Maintenance Software User Manual (page 13). Properly clearing wireless network authentication credentials is recommended when emergency patient transport is imminent, or when a device may be out of staff control.Users are advised to change their wireless network authentication credentials regularly, and immediately if there is evidence of unauthorized physical access to an Alaris device at their facility. Additionally, all wireless credentials should be cleared prior to transferring an Alaris device to another facility. Where feasible, users are encouraged to utilize enterprise-grade authentication methods, (e.g., EAP-TLS).Users are strongly encouraged to consider security policy in which wireless credentials are not configured for the Alaris PCU if wireless networking functionality is not being utilized for operation. This will remediate the vulnerability for non-wireless users. --------- Begin Update B Part 6 of 6 -------- If requesting the Alaris PCU to be enabled in FIPS mode, users are advised to implement a policy of placing tamper-evident seals on the rear access panel and on the grooves of both sides of the Alaris PCU. --------- End Update B Part 6 of 6 -------- Users may choose to implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) that restrict device access to specific media access control (MAC) and IP addresses, ports, protocols, and services.

This includes both inbound and outbound ports and services, which blocks most of the access to the server and will protect it from being affected by this vulnerability.If a firewall is integrated between the server network segment and its wireless network segments, implement a firewall rule with an access control list (ACL) that restricts access to the wireless network segment via the specific MAC address of the wireless card on the pump. This would restrict access to the wireless segment to only authorized devices and not allow other devices to connect and authenticate to the segment.BD Alaris Systems Manager should be considered a critical service. Whenever possible, it should operate on a secured network behind a firewall, be patched regularly, and have malware protection.Disable any unnecessary accounts, protocols, and services. The combination of these actions can restrict what devices or systems can be on the segment and the types of traffic that could be used between the wireless network segment and the server segment where the Systems Manager Server is located. These controls will help to mitigate and reduce the impact of this type of attack. For additional information please see theBD product security bulletin.

      <td>A remote code execution vulnerability called BlueKeep (CVE0708) exists within the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) used by the Microsoft Windows operating systems listed below. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform remote code execution on an unprotected system. According to Microsoft, an attacker can send specially crafted packets to operating systems with RDP enabled.  After successfully sending the packets the attacker could perform a number of actions, including adding accounts with full user rights; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or installing programs. This exploit, which requires no user interaction, must occur for successful authentication. BlueKeep is considered “worm-able” because malware exploiting this vulnerability on a system could propagate to other vulnerable systems; thus a BlueKeep exploit would be capable of rapidly spreading like the WannaCry malware attacks of 2017.</td>
      <td>The following versions and operating systems of Spacelabs Xhibit Telemetry Receiver are affected: Xhibit Telemetry Receiver (XTR), Model number 96280, v1.0.2Arkon (99999), all versions – previously sold by Spacelabs, no longer a supported product The following Microsoft Windows operating systems, including both 32bit versions, as well as all Service Pack versions, are affected: Windows 2000Windows VistaWindows XPWindows 7Windows Server 2003Windows Server 2003 R2Windows Server 2008Windows Server 2008 R2</td>
      <td>IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20 The affected product is vulnerable to a remote code execution vulnerability that exists in Remote Desktop Services (formerly known as Terminal Services) when an unauthenticated attacker connects to the target system using RDP and sends specially crafted requests. This vulnerability is pre-authentication and requires no user interaction. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code on the target system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted request to the target system’s Remote Desktop Service via RDP. CVE-2019-0708 has been assigned to this vulnerability.</td>
      <td>The vulnerability was originally discovered by Microsoft. Spacelabs then reported the vulnerability to CISA.</td>
      <td>Spacelabs has determined the recommended remediation is to update to the newest release v1.2.1 or later. All deployed XTR hardware appliances are capable of update and should be updated.Many Spacelabs products are appliances and users are not intended to perform updates on them. Products or systems that are obsolete or are not able to be patched may use this alternate mitigation step to help protect against BlueKeep: Block Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Port 3389 at the enterprise perimeter firewall. Because Port 3389 is used to initiate an RDP session, blocking it prevents an attacker from exploiting BlueKeep from outside the user’s network. However, this will block legitimate RDP sessions and may not prevent unauthenticated sessions from being initiated inside a network. Spacelabs also encourages users and administrators to review theMicrosoft Security Advisoryand theMicrosoft Customer Guidance for CVE-2019-0708and apply the appropriate mitigation measures as soon as possible. If you own an XTR device or have any questions about this security advisory, please contact Spacelabs at 1-800-522-7025 and select 2 for technical support. XTR is an appliance that has no user interface, so your service representative can help you to determine the installed version of software on your XTR product and will work to coordinate updates as needed. For additional information about this vulnerability, please see theSpacelabs Security Advisory. CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should: Minimize network exposure for all medical devices and/or systems.Locate medical devices behind firewalls and isolate them where possible.Restrict system access to authorized personnel only and follow a least privilege approach.Apply defense-in-depth strategies.Disable any unnecessary accounts, protocols and services.Where additional information is needed, refer toexisting cybersecurity in medical device guidanceissued by the FDA.

CVE-2018-5446 has been assigned to this vulnerability. RELATIVE PATH TRAVERSAL CWE-23 The affected product’s software deployment network contains a directory traversal vulnerability that could allow an attacker to read files on the system. CVE-2018-5448 has been assigned to this vulnerability. IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF COMMUNICATION CHANNEL TO INTENDED ENDPOINTS CWE-923 The affected product uses a virtual private network connection to securely download updates. The product does not verify it is still connected to this virtual private network before downloading updates. The affected products initially establish an encapsulated IP-based VPN connection to a Medtronic-hosted update network. Once the VPN is established, it makes a request to a HTTP (non-TLS) server across the VPN for updates, which responds and provides any available updates. The programmer-side (client) service responsible for this HTTP request does not check to ensure it is still connected to the VPN before making the HTTP request. Thus, an attacker could cause the VPN connection to terminate (through various methods and attack points) and intercept the HTTP request, responding with malicious updates via a man-in-the-middle attack. The affected products do not verify the origin or integrity of these updates, as it insufficiently relied on the security of the VPN. An attacker with remote network access to the programmer could influence these communications. CVE-2018-10596 has been assigned to this vulnerability. (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).</td>

Medtronic reports that they will not be issuing a product update; however, Medtronic has identified compensating controls within this advisory to reduce the risk of exploitation and reiterates the following from the CareLink 2090 Programmer Reference Manual: Maintain good physical controls over the programmer. Having a secure physical environment prevents access to the internals of the programmer.Only connect the programmer to managed, secure networks.Update the software on the programmer when Medtronic updates are available.Alternatively, disconnect the programmer from the network. Network connectivity is not required for normal programmer operation.Offline updates are available, contact your Medtronic representative for more information. --------- Begin Update C Part 1 of 1 -------- Medtronic has deployed mitigating patches to address the reported vulnerabilities. Medtronic has also stated that they have increased security controls associated with these vulnerabilities. As a result of the available mitigating patches, Medtronic has re-enabled the network-based software update mechanism. Medtronic has stated that the patch for affected products can be obtained by contacting Medtronic Technical Services at 800‑638‑1991. --------- End Update C Part 1 of 1 -------- After additional review and risk evaluation of the affected products, Medtronic has disabled the network-based software update mechanism, including both the VPN and the HTTP subservices, as an immediate security mitigation. Users should not attempt to update the affected products over the network as this update mechanism is vulnerable to the attack described in section 4.2.3. Medtronic will continue to implement and deploy increased security protections and mitigations to address the vulnerabilities in this advisory.

      <td>STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121 This vulnerability resides in the IPv4 option parsing and may be triggered by IPv4 packets containing invalid options.The most likely outcome of triggering this defect is that the tNet0 task crashes. This vulnerability can result in remote code execution. CVE-2019-12256 has been assigned to this vulnerability. HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122 DHCP packets may go past the local area network (LAN) via DHCP-relays, but are otherwise confined to the LAN.The DHCP-client may be used by VxWorks and in the bootrom. Bootrom, using DHCP/BOOTP, is only vulnerable during the boot-process. This vulnerability may be used to overwrite the heap, which could result in a later crash when a task requests memory from the heap. This vulnerability can result in remote code execution. CVE-2019-12257 has been assigned to this vulnerability. INTEGER UNDERFLOW (WRAP OR WRAPAROUND) CWE-191 An attacker can either hijack an existing TCP session and inject bad TCP segments or establish a new TCP session on any TCP port listened to by the target. This vulnerability could lead to a buffer overflow of up to a full TCP receive-window (by default, 10k-64k depending on version). The buffer overflow occurs in the task calling recv()/recvfrom()/recvmsg(). Applications that pass a buffer equal to or larger than a full TCP window are not susceptible to this attack. Applications passing a stack-allocated variable as a buffer are the easiest to exploit. The most likely outcome is a crash of the application reading from the affected socket, which could result in remote code execution. CVE-2019-12255 has been assigned to this vulnerability. IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119 This vulnerability could lead to a buffer overflow of up to a full TCP receive window (by default, 10k-64k depending on version).

Applications passing a stack-allocated variable as a buffer are the easiest to exploit. The most likely outcome is a crash of the application reading from the affected socket, which could result in remote code execution. CVE-2019-12260 has been assigned to this vulnerability. IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119 The impact of this vulnerability is a buffer overflow of up to a full TCP receive window (by default, 10k-64k depending on version). The buffer overflow happens in the task calling recv()/recvfrom()/recvmsg(). Applications that pass a buffer equal to or larger than a full TCP window are not susceptible to this attack. Applications passing a stack-allocated variable as a buffer are the easiest to exploit. The most likely outcome is a crash of the application reading from the affected socket, which could result in remote code execution. CVE-2019-12261 has been assigned to this vulnerability. CONCURRENT EXECUTION USING SHARED RESOURCE WITH IMPROPER SYNCHRONIZATION ('RACE CONDITION') CWE-362 This vulnerability relies on a race-condition between the network task (tNet0) and the receiving application. It is very difficult to trigger the race on a system with a single CPU-thread enabled, and there is no way to reliably trigger a race on SMP targets. CVE-2019-12263 has been assigned to this vulnerability. IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF ARGUMENT DELIMITERS IN A COMMAND ('ARGUMENT INJECTION') CWE-88 An attacker with the source and destination TCP-port and IP-addresses of a session can inject invalid TCP segments into the flow, causing the TCP-session to be reset. An application will see this as an ECONNRESET error message when using the socket after such an attack. The most likely outcome is a crash of the application reading from the affected socket. CVE-2019-12258 has been assigned to this vulnerability. NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476 This vulnerability requires that at least one IPv4 multicast address has been assigned to the target in an incorrect way (e.g, using the API intended for assigning unicast addresses). An attacker may useCVE-2019-12264to incorrectly assign a multicast IP-address. An attacker on the same LAN as the target system may use this vulnerability to cause a NULL pointer dereference, which most likely will crash the tNet0 task. CVE-2019-12259 has been assigned to this vulnerability. IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF ARGUMENT DELIMITERS IN A COMMAND ('ARGUMENT INJECTION') CWE-88 An attacker residing on the LAN can send reverse-ARP responses to the victim system to assign unicast IPv4 addresses to the target. CVE-2019-12262 has been assigned to this vulnerability. IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF ARGUMENT DELIMITERS IN A COMMAND ('ARGUMENT INJECTION') CWE-88 An attacker residing on the LAN may choose to hijack a DHCP-client session that requests an IPv4 address. The attacker can send a multicast IP address in the DHCP offer/ack message, which the victim system then incorrectly assigns. This vulnerability can be combined withCVE-2019-12259to create a denial-of-service condition. CVE-2019-12264 has been assigned to this vulnerability. IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF ARGUMENT DELIMITERS IN A COMMAND ('ARGUMENT INJECTION') CWE-88 The IGMPv3 reception handler does not expect packets to be spread across multiple IP-fragments.

INTEGER UNDERFLOW (WRAP OR WRAPAROUND) CWE-191 An attacker can either hijack an existing TCP session and inject bad TCP segments or establish a new TCP session on any TCP port listened to by the target. This vulnerability could lead to a buffer overflow of up to a full TCP receive-window (by default, 10k-64k depending on version). The buffer overflow occurs in the task calling recv()/recvfrom()/recvmsg(). Applications that pass a buffer equal to or larger than a full TCP window are not susceptible to this attack. Applications passing a stack-allocated variable as a buffer are the easiest to exploit. The most likely outcome is a crash of the application reading from the affected socket, which could result in remote code execution. CVE-2019-12255 has been assigned to this vulnerability. IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119 This vulnerability could lead to a buffer overflow of up to a full TCP receive window (by default, 10k-64k depending on version). The buffer overflow happens in the task calling recv()/recvfrom()/recvmsg(). Applications that pass a buffer equal to or larger than a full TCP window are not susceptible to this attack. Applications passing a stack-allocated variable as a buffer are the easiest to exploit. The most likely outcome is a crash of the application reading from the affected socket, which could result in remote code execution. CVE-2019-12260 has been assigned to this vulnerability. IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119 The impact of this vulnerability is a buffer overflow of up to a full TCP receive window (by default, 10k-64k depending on version). The buffer overflow happens in the task calling recv()/recvfrom()/recvmsg(). Applications that pass a buffer equal to or larger than a full TCP window are not susceptible to this attack. Applications passing a stack-allocated variable as a buffer are the easiest to exploit. The most likely outcome is a crash of the application reading from the affected socket, which could result in remote code execution. CVE-2019-12261 has been assigned to this vulnerability. CONCURRENT EXECUTION USING SHARED RESOURCE WITH IMPROPER SYNCHRONIZATION ('RACE CONDITION') CWE-362 This vulnerability relies on a race-condition between the network task (tNet0) and the receiving application. It is very difficult to trigger the race on a system with a single CPU-thread enabled, and there is no way to reliably trigger a race on SMP targets. CVE-2019-12263 has been assigned to this vulnerability. IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF ARGUMENT DELIMITERS IN A COMMAND ('ARGUMENT INJECTION') CWE-88 An attacker with the source and destination TCP-port and IP-addresses of a session can inject invalid TCP segments into the flow, causing the TCP-session to be reset. An application will see this as an ECONNRESET error message when using the socket after such an attack. The most likely outcome is a crash of the application reading from the affected socket. CVE-2019-12258 has been assigned to this vulnerability. NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476 This vulnerability requires that at least one IPv4 multicast address has been assigned to the target in an incorrect way (e.g, using the API intended for assigning unicast addresses). An attacker may useCVE-2019-12264to incorrectly assign a multicast IP-address. An attacker on the same LAN as the target system may use this vulnerability to cause a NULL pointer dereference, which most likely will crash the tNet0 task. CVE-2019-12259 has been assigned to this vulnerability. IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF ARGUMENT DELIMITERS IN A COMMAND ('ARGUMENT INJECTION') CWE-88 An attacker residing on the LAN can send reverse-ARP responses to the victim system to assign unicast IPv4 addresses to the target. CVE-2019-12262 has been assigned to this vulnerability. IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF ARGUMENT DELIMITERS IN A COMMAND ('ARGUMENT INJECTION') CWE-88 An attacker residing on the LAN may choose to hijack a DHCP-client session that requests an IPv4 address. The attacker can send a multicast IP address in the DHCP offer/ack message, which the victim system then incorrectly assigns. This vulnerability can be combined withCVE-2019-12259to create a denial-of-service condition. CVE-2019-12264 has been assigned to this vulnerability. IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF ARGUMENT DELIMITERS IN A COMMAND ('ARGUMENT INJECTION') CWE-88 The IGMPv3 reception handler does not expect packets to be spread across multiple IP-fragments.

Wind River reports the following versions of VxWorks are affected: All versions of VxWorks under CURRENT support (6.9.4.11, Vx7 SR540, Vx7 SR610) are affected by one or more of the CVE numbers detailed below.Older, endlife versions of VxWorks back to 6.5 are also affected by one or more of the CVE numbers below.All versions of the discontinued product Advanced Networking Technology (ANT) are likely affected by one or more of the CVE numbers below.The VxWorks bootrom network stack leverages the same IPnet source as VxWorks and, as a result, is also technically vulnerable to CVE12256. The same patches and mitigations apply to VxWorks and the bootrom network stack; however, the bootrom normally uses statically assigned IPports, which means that the TCP-related issues must be timed with the target downloading data from the network.VxWorks 653 MCE 3.x may be affected. Contact Wind River customer support (support@windriver.com) for more details. The following VxWorks products are not affected: The latest release of VxWorks, VxWorks 7 SR620, is NOT affected by any of these CVEsVxWorks 5.3 through VxWorks 6.4 inclusive are NOT affected.VxWorks Cert versions are NOT affected.VxWorks 653 Versions 2.x and earlier are NOT affected.VxWorks 653 MCE 3.x Cert Edition and later are NOT affected. CISA will update this document as more mitigations are identified by affected vendors.</td>
      <td>STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121 This vulnerability resides in the IPv4 option parsing and may be triggered by IPv4 packets containing invalid options.The most likely outcome of triggering this defect is that the tNet0 task crashes. This vulnerability can result in remote code execution. CVE-2019-12256 has been assigned to this vulnerability. HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122 DHCP packets may go past the local area network (LAN) via DHCP-relays, but are otherwise confined to the LAN.The DHCP-client may be used by VxWorks and in the bootrom. Bootrom, using DHCP/BOOTP, is only vulnerable during the boot-process. This vulnerability may be used to overwrite the heap, which could result in a later crash when a task requests memory from the heap. This vulnerability can result in remote code execution. CVE-2019-12257 has been assigned to this vulnerability. INTEGER UNDERFLOW (WRAP OR WRAPAROUND) CWE-191 An attacker can either hijack an existing TCP session and inject bad TCP segments or establish a new TCP session on any TCP port listened to by the target. This vulnerability could lead to a buffer overflow of up to a full TCP receive-window (by default, 10k-64k depending on version). The buffer overflow occurs in the task calling recv()/recvfrom()/recvmsg(). Applications that pass a buffer equal to or larger than a full TCP window are not susceptible to this attack. Applications passing a stack-allocated variable as a buffer are the easiest to exploit. The most likely outcome is a crash of the application reading from the affected socket, which could result in remote code execution. CVE-2019-12255 has been assigned to this vulnerability. IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119 This vulnerability could lead to a buffer overflow of up to a full TCP receive window (by default, 10k-64k depending on version). The buffer overflow happens in the task calling recv()/recvfrom()/recvmsg(). Applications that pass a buffer equal to or larger than a full TCP window are not susceptible to this attack. Applications passing a stack-allocated variable as a buffer are the easiest to exploit. The most likely outcome is a crash of the application reading from the affected socket, which could result in remote code execution. CVE-2019-12260 has been assigned to this vulnerability. IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119 The impact of this vulnerability is a buffer overflow of up to a full TCP receive window (by default, 10k-64k depending on version). The buffer overflow happens in the task calling recv()/recvfrom()/recvmsg(). Applications that pass a buffer equal to or larger than a full TCP window are not susceptible to this attack. Applications passing a stack-allocated variable as a buffer are the easiest to exploit. The most likely outcome is a crash of the application reading from the affected socket, which could result in remote code execution. CVE-2019-12261 has been assigned to this vulnerability. CONCURRENT EXECUTION USING SHARED RESOURCE WITH IMPROPER SYNCHRONIZATION ('RACE CONDITION') CWE-362 This vulnerability relies on a race-condition between the network task (tNet0) and the receiving application. It is very difficult to trigger the race on a system with a single CPU-thread enabled, and there is no way to reliably trigger a race on SMP targets. CVE-2019-12263 has been assigned to this vulnerability. IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF ARGUMENT DELIMITERS IN A COMMAND ('ARGUMENT INJECTION') CWE-88 An attacker with the source and destination TCP-port and IP-addresses of a session can inject invalid TCP segments into the flow, causing the TCP-session to be reset. An application will see this as an ECONNRESET error message when using the socket after such an attack. The most likely outcome is a crash of the application reading from the affected socket. CVE-2019-12258 has been assigned to this vulnerability. NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476 This vulnerability requires that at least one IPv4 multicast address has been assigned to the target in an incorrect way (e.g, using the API intended for assigning unicast addresses). An attacker may useCVE-2019-12264to incorrectly assign a multicast IP-address. An attacker on the same LAN as the target system may use this vulnerability to cause a NULL pointer dereference, which most likely will crash the tNet0 task. CVE-2019-12259 has been assigned to this vulnerability. IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF ARGUMENT DELIMITERS IN A COMMAND ('ARGUMENT INJECTION') CWE-88 An attacker residing on the LAN can send reverse-ARP responses to the victim system to assign unicast IPv4 addresses to the target. CVE-2019-12262 has been assigned to this vulnerability. IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF ARGUMENT DELIMITERS IN A COMMAND ('ARGUMENT INJECTION') CWE-88 An attacker residing on the LAN may choose to hijack a DHCP-client session that requests an IPv4 address. The attacker can send a multicast IP address in the DHCP offer/ack message, which the victim system then incorrectly assigns. This vulnerability can be combined withCVE-2019-12259to create a denial-of-service condition. CVE-2019-12264 has been assigned to this vulnerability. IMPROPER NEUTRALIZATION OF ARGUMENT DELIMITERS IN A COMMAND ('ARGUMENT INJECTION') CWE-88 The IGMPv3 reception handler does not expect packets to be spread across multiple IP-fragments. CVE-2019-12265 has been assigned to this vulnerability.</td>

According to Abbott, these devices are deployed across the healthcare and public health sector. Abbott indicates that these products are used worldwide.</td>
      <td>MedSec Holdings Ltd., reported these vulnerabilities to Abbott Laboratories and NCCIC.</td>
      <td>Abbott has developed a firmware update to help mitigate the identified vulnerabilities. The firmware update provides additional security to reduce the risk of unauthorized access by bypassing authentication to the following high voltage device families that utilize wireless radio frequency (RF) communication: Fortify, Fortify Assura, Quadra Assura, Quadra Assura MP, Unify, Unify Assura, Unify Quadra, Promote Quadra, and Ellipse. The firmware update can be applied to an eligible implanted ICD or CRT-D via the Merlin PCS Programmer by a healthcare provider. Abbott and FDA have recommended the update to all eligible patients at the next regularly scheduled visit or when appropriate depending on the preferences of the patient and physician. ICDs and CRT-Ds manufactured beginning April 25, 2018, will have these updates preloaded on devices. Abbott states that firmware updates should be approached with caution. As with any software update, firmware updates can cause devices to malfunction. Potential risks include discomfort due to back-up VVI pacing settings, reloading of previous firmware version due to incomplete upgrade, inability to treat VT/VF while in back-up mode given high voltage therapy is disabled, device remaining in back-up mode due to unsuccessful upgrade, and loss of currently-programmed device settings or diagnostic data. The Abbott Cybersecurity Medical Advisory Board has reviewed this firmware update and the associated risk of performing the update in the context of potential cybersecurity risk. While not intended to serve as a substitute for clinician judgment as to whether the firmware update is advisable for a particular patient, the Cybersecurity Medical Advisory Board recommends the following: Healthcare providers and patients should discuss the risks and benefits of the cybersecurity vulnerabilities and associated firmware update during the next regularly scheduled visit or when appropriate depending on the preferences of the patient and physician. As part of this discussion, it is important to consider patient-specific issues such as pacemaker dependence, frequency of high voltage therapy, age of device, patient preference, and provide patients with the “Patient Communication.”Determine if the update is appropriate given the risk of update for the patient. If deemed appropriate, install this firmware update following the instructions provided by the manufacturer.The cybersecurity firmware update should be performed in a facility where appropriate monitoring and external defibrillation are readily available. Abbott’s older generation devices (i.e., Current and Promote) are not capable of accepting the firmware update due to technology limitations. If healthcare providers and patients have any concerns relating to device cybersecurity for those patients implanted with Current/Promote devices, providers have the option to permanently disable the RF communication capability in the device. However, if this option is selected, the patient can no longer be monitored remotely using an RF Merlin@home transmitter. For most patients, permanently disabling RF is not advisable given the proven benefits and improved survival associated with home monitoring. Therefore, the Medical Advisory Boards recommends the following: Healthcare providers and patients should discuss the risks of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and benefits of remote monitoring at the next regularly scheduled visit or when appropriate depending on the preferences of the patient and physician.If deemed appropriate, RF communication may be permanently disabled during an in-clinic device interrogation with the Merlin programmer software.
