dividing each M-line into 8 sub-regions or according to user defined 
sub-region sizes, point of interest tool obtains values from any point 
on the M-mode display. In addition to the Tissue Doppler based 
strain system should have 2D based strain like VVI, AFI, and TMQ 
should be offered. These should be offered both on the system and on 
a licensed workstation. OFF Cart workstation (both licensed 
hardware and licensed software) should be offered and highlighted in 
the technical bid. 
13. System should be offered with user-friendly high-resolution user 
interface touch panel of minimum size of 10-11 inches or intuitive 
keyboard. User friendliness will be given preference. 
14. Should be able to perform MPR views for Quantification from 3D 
Imaging on Volume measurements like LV volumes, Ejection 
fraction from 3D Image, etc. Also should offer 3D synchronicity 
indicates to measure and compare timing of maximum contraction of 
regional LV volumes. Should display global LV volume and should 
provide simultaneous display of 17 regional volume waveform. This 
should be offered both OFFLINE as well as online. OFF-LINE 
workstation of Apple or equivalent brand (Both hardware and 
software) should be supplied and highlighted in the technical bid. 
15. The quantification capabilities should be offered OFF-LINE also. The 
system images should be transferred through DICOM to the OFF-
LINE licensed workstation. The workstation should have a DICOM 
Image Management System Software loaded so as to print images 
through a Colour laser printer. 
16. The system should have the facility of displaying the three planes of 
the 3D data set. 
17. Contrast harmonic imaging should be offered as standard on the 
system, with optimization for low and high MI applications. Should 
also have facility of low MI with triggered replenishment imaging. 
18. Integrated stress echo facility to perform stress echo exams.
