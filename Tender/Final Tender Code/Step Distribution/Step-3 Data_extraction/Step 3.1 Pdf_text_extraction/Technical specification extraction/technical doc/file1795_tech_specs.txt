3. Technical Bid (Specification) :  
 
Name of the e -Tender : Supply, Installation &Commissioning of Automated 
Media Preparation System at AIIMS, Bhubaneswar. 
 
3.1 Schedule of Requirements: 
 
The institute requires 01no. set of Automated Media Preparation System to be used by the 
Department of ENT. The equipment is/are to be delivered within 90 days from placing of 
Purchase Order at the Central Store of AIIMS Bhubaneswar at the quoted/ negotiated price 
without any additional cost to the institute as per specifications given below. 
3.2 SPECIFICATIONS OF AUTOMATED MEDIA PREPARATION SYSTEM: 
 
S NO 
DETAILED SPECIFICATIONS: 
Remarks 
A 
Automated Media Preparation System, 10L : 
Product Specification : 
 
1 
Fast, reproducible and safe media preparation & sterilization of 1 to 10 L media in a 
single run with low dead volume (<15 ml).  
 
2 
Certified by CE & TUV Product Services GmbH to be compliant to the UL 61010-1 and 
IEC 61010-1 international safety standards.  
 
3 
High operational safety:  
 
(i) 
Automatic tightness check, several independent micro-processor based monitoring 
systems for pressure and temperature.  
 
(ii) 
The vessel lid is equipped with an autonomous overpressure safety valve and a burst disc 
with a self-test every 50 cycles, which locks the system if not conducted, thus ensures 
that the preparator runs with a regularly tested safety valve.  
 
4 
Automatic temperature (using Pt-1000 temperature probe) and pressure controlled 
deaeration to ensuring saturated steam inside the sterilisation chamber.  
 
5 
Ease of maintenance with inbuilt cleaning program and equipment design.  
 
(i) 
The absence of any heating element within the sterilization vessel makes the cleaning of 
the vessel easy.  
 
(ii) 
The integrated self-cleaning procedure automatically sterilizes the vessel, valves and the 
tubing inside the chamber. Hot, sterile coupling water is drained at the process end; 
dissolving and removing unwanted agar residues in the system effectively.  
 
6 
Integrated strong, bidirectional magnetic stirrer to guarantee homogenous mixing and 
prevent coagulation with Stirrer speed (selectable): 50-200rpm.  
 
7 
Should be compatible with automated media dispensing systems for walk-away filling of 
petri dishes, test tubes and media bottles.  
 
8 
Automatic in-process sterilisation of the dispense port to exclude contaminations during 
dispensing to guarantee complete sterilisation  
 
9 
Preparation Media preparator should be complete with cuvette, lid, seal, magnetic stirrer, 
decanting tube, fitting for dispensing tubing, integrated printer and printer splash guard.  
 
10 
Built in operation modes like standard media, complex media involving two-step 
program, eg: chocolate agar, etc.  
 
11 
Water bath mode for pre-swelling culture media prior to sterilization.  
 
12 
Flow heater system for fast and gentle media preparation.  
 
13 
Precise controlling and monitoring of time and pressure during the sterilization 
process.  
 
14 
Temperature range: Sterilization 30 to 122 degC, Dispensing 20 to 80 degC, Water Bath 
30 to 80 degC. with Max temp deviation: +1.0/-0.2 degC.
