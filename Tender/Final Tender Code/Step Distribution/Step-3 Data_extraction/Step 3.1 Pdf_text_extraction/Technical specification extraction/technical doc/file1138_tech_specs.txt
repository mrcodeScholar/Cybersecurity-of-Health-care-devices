least 30-40 basic task training exercises for students such as: 
a) Basic Probe Movement & Orientation: Time bound exercise, 
with/without the aid of reference image to help understanding 
of basic probe handling and movements with metrics.  
b) Setting, Adjustment: Facilitate trainees to optimize best image 
settings for different views, with adjustments of DOF, Beam 
angle, Gain & Contrast. Expert can verify the outcome after 
completion of exercise.

exercise and after completion expert can evaluate the 
performance.

to use different measurement tools, with/without reference 
image.   
 Abdominal: System should have at least 10-15 basic task training 
exercises such as
