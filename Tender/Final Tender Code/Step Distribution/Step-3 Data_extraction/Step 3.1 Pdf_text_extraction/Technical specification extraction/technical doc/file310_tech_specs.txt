Osmometer 
 
Measuring Principle 
Osmometer should operate on the vapor 
pressure depression principle 
Sample Volume 
It shall be capable of routine osmolality 
determinations on sample volumes of 10 
microliters and still lower volumes upto 2 
microlitre using special adapters. 
Measurement process 
Measurement should be performed 
automatically once the chamber is 
closed after addition of sample. 
Sample type 
It should be able to use any biological 
specimen, viscous samples, or  thin slices of 
tissue sample (both animal & plant). 
Measuring Range 
It should have a measuring range covering 
20 to 3200 mmol/kg with a linearity of ± 5% 
Routine Maintenance 
The osmometer shall have an automated 
thermocouple cleaning cycle and not require 
any routine maintenance 
Measurement 
resolution 
Results should be expressed in a minimum 
of 1 mmol/kg resolution. 
Calibration process 
It should have automatic calibration using 
maximum 3 different standards 
Compact design 
The system should be a single integrated 
unit having measuring , controlling and 
result output modules as one system 
Display Screen 
Device should have inbuilt screen to display 
results 
Speed of result 
Measuring time per sample : approx. 90 sec 
Auto-repeat 
It should be able to take upto 10 repeat 
measurements on same sample and display 
statistical data after each assay for accuracy 
checks 
Low running cost 
It should use minimal consumables for 
routine operations 
Operating 
Temperature 
The device should be capable to be used in 
temperature range of 15° to 37 °C
