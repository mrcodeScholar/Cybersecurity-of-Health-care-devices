       Multiple Calipers, including Arbitrary A-Scan. This unique function provides a very 
precise tool        to measure distances on microns scale. The user defines a line crossing 
the structures to be measured and the tool provides an A Scan Vector overlay to help 
identify precisely the interfaces. Finally 2 measuring gates allows to measure in microns. 
Angle Measurement 
Area Zoom: Pro 2000 (Ishikawa Algorithm) 
G.  Image Capture: 
Video on the images captured. It saves every frame captured by the grabber which can 
be played back later as a sequence looking like a video clip. Once analyzed, the 
sequence can be exported as an AVI file to be seen on any compatible computer. 
BMP, RLE, or JPG Photo Formats AVI Movies Format 
H.  Image Functions 
Exclusive proprietary algorithm “Focus” based on the principle of deconvolution, 
allowing increasing the resolution to 19 microns (size of a pixel) 
Exclusive E-Gain (exponential gain), which provides a selective amplification of the pure 
interfaces (echoes) keeping background noise on a low level. 
Unique presets which allows the unit to run with the appropriate settings depending the 
area or function the user is willing to explore. They are “Sulcus to Sulcus”, “High 
Resolution”, Angle Detail” and “Motion Picture”. 
 
Unique Pro 2000 Post processing image analysis algorithm to make an objective anterior 
chamber angle evaluation. It provides data like ARA (Angle Recess Area), SS to IR 
(sclera Spur to Iris Root), AOD (Angle opening Distance) at 250 and 500 microns form 
the sclera Spur. It also provides a graphical display showing the progression of the angle 
aperture and distances from the endothelium to the anterior Iris surfaces.
