ANNEXURE-I 
DETAILED TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION FOR 
MALDI-TOF MS 
 
 
 
1. Fully automated with suitable software, work stations and full available database for full 
microbial identifications including bacterial (Gram Positive, Gram Negative, aerobic, 
anaerobic), Fungal (Yeast and molds), Mycobacterial (MTB complex and NTM) and 
filamentous bacteria. 
2. The system should also be capable of doing basic protein analysis such as Molecular 
weight profiling, dendogram production, biomarker analysis, ans SNP studies. 
3. Instrumentation –  
3.1 The instrument should be fully automated working on the principle of matrix 
assisted laser desorption ionization – time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass 
spectrometry technology. 
3.2 Should have linear time of flight (TOF) measurement. 
3.3 Should have oil free vacuum pumps for easy maintenance.  
3.4 Should be equipped with nitrogen laser preferably 337 nm with repetition rate 
upto1-60 Hz. 
3.5 Should be FDA approved and have CE and IVD certifications. 
4. Software –  
4.1 Should be windows based, easy to use and versatile. 
4.2 Result should be directly displayed as species of microbes. 
4.3 Should be capable of doing in-depth analysis with bioinformatics tools for sub 
typing and dendogram. 
4.4 Should have taxonomic trees against reference spectra concerning taxonomic 
relationship. 
5. Analytical parameters  
5.1 Capable of identifying microbes upto species level. 
5.2 Sensitive enough to detect low amount of cells ~ 105 cells. 
5.3 Capable of denoting taxonomical classification 
5.4 Capable of denoting mixed population (atleast 2 species) in a mixed culture. 
6. Database  
6.1 Should be integrated with a ready to use reference library. 
6.2 The reference library provided should be upto date. 
6.3 The database should have automatic regular updates when available. 
7. Custom library 
7.1 System should have software capability to generate database for new microbial 
species by the user at his laboratory itself. 
7.2 Database should have an open architecture to allow customize in-house library 
generation.
