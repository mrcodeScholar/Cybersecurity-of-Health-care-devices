Specification of Near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS) system  
 
1. 
Near infra-red spectroscopy system is a monitor to measure cerebral/somatic oximetry  
2. 
NIRS technology is used to detect changes in regional blood oxygen saturation (rSO2) in the brain and 
skeletal muscles (somatic) tissue of the body. 
3. 
The equipment should be non-invasive and can be used safely in neonates 
4. 
Monitors must have provision of 4 channels capable of monitoring two tissue sites concentrations 
simultaneously. 
5. 
Monitor should measure regional oxygen saturations in the range of rSO2 15-95. Values must be updated 
at regular intervals typically every 5 seconds or less. 
6. 
Must comply with biomedical safety standards of the USFDA or European CE. 
7. 
System should meet all international regulatory standards like EN 60601-1 
8. 
Should be user friendly with pre-calibration and ready to use in 30 seconds 
9. 
Sensors self-calibration automatically by system 
10. 
Should be able to perform automatic self-test. 
11. 
Monitor should be applicable to neonatal patients in any clinical setting where the brain and body are at 
risk of reduced-flow or no-flow ischemic states. 
12. 
Accuracy for reading must be within ± 5 rSO2 unit of actual. Repeatability must be ± 1-2 rSO2 units. 
13. 
Power requirement: 100-240 VAC, 50/60 Hz, 1.0A – 0.5A with connects for external AC mains and 
battery backup of approximately 20 minutes 
14. 
Trend memory of 24 hours at 2 samples per minute with maximum of 28 cases saved 
15. 
Digital out-put RS232 communications& USB 2.0 flash memory 
16. 
Battery backup at least 12VDC; approximately 20 minutes. 
17. 
Should have USB Port USB 2.0 Flash Memory  
18. 
Should be provided with appropriate accessories and sensors.  
19. 
Weight of equipment should not be more than 5 kg. 
20. 
It should have ANALYTICAL TOOL which has data storage memory of 28 cases or more. 
21. 
Should be supplied with 50 suitable neonatal sensors. 
22. 
General requirement for Electrical safety of Medical Equipment.  
 
General specifications: 
1. 
Memory of all set and measured parameters for at least 120 hours.  
2. 
Ability to transfer data to portable media/computer. If any software or cables are required for this, they should 
be provided.  
3. 
Comprehensive warranty & CMC for at least 5 years from date of installation with at least 3-monthly 
visits for routine checking and whenever called for troubleshooting. 
4. 
Consumables should be provided as per CMC for 5 years.  
5. 
List of consumables should be quoted with individual prices separately and rates should be frozen for a 
period of next 5 years beyond warranty/CMC. 
6. 
Should have spare part & service available for another 5 years after completion of CMC.  
7. 
Onsite physical demonstration/training of the equipment to all the end users with all the requested facilities will be mandatory 
8. 
Documentation  
a. 
User/Technical/Maintenance manuals to be supplied in English  
b. 
Certificate of calibration and inspection from factory 
9. 
General requirement for Electrical safety of Medical Equipment  
10. 
Should have local service facility with response time of less than 24 hrs 
11. 
The service provider should have the necessary equipment’s recommended by the manufacturer to carry 
out preventive maintenance test as per guidelines provided in the service/maintenance manual 
12.    “MAKE IN INDIA” Product will be preferred
