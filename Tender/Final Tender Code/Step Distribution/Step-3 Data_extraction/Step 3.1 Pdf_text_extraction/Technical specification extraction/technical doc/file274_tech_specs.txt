Specification of Radiofrequency Ablator: 
1. 
Ablation based on low temperature Bl-Polar Radio frequency technology. Should not have 
any need for the secondary patient grounding pad. 
2. 
The RF probe should have Multi Electrode Technology that will allow a uniform production 
of plasma. 
3. 
The output voltage settings should be controlled by regulation on the generator from setting 
1-10. 
4. 
The generator should have a feature of Automatic scope saver, i.e. when the probe comes too 
close to endoscope the controller pauses radiofrequency output and resumes radiofrequency output 
when the probe is returned to safe distance. 
5. 
The generator should have facility to use a foot control or a wireless footswitch for 
convenience and ease of use. There should also be hand control for multiple functions on the probes. 
6.         System should have intuitive touchscreen control 
7.        There should be facility to adjust coblation and coagulation with diferent settings 
8         There should be a facility in the generator to monitor inside temp in the joint while using the 
probes 
9.       The generator should also have the facility to use a finger switch controlled probes 
10.     The RF generator should be able to take a wide range of probes for Tendon and fascia 
treatments also. 
11.    Thermal Penetration should not be more than 150 Micron. 
12.    The probes should not auto-disable after certain hours of use or after single use. They should 
withstand power interruptions 
13.    Consumables: 20 probes 3.5 mm, 90 degrees. 
14.    Two years rate contract for the compatible consumables should be provided at the tinme of 
tender 
15.    Warranty 5 years should be included in the price, % years CMC should be provided.
