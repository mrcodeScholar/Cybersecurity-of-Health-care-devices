ANNEXURE-I 
Technical Specification for ELISA Reader Cum Spectrophotometer 
1. Should be a spectral scanning unit for UV-visible-Near IR wavelength range, 
with dedicated cuvette port (with no extra attachments) and should be able to 
read 96 & 384 micro well plate format. 
2. Should work as a standalone system without computer and be able to run with 
computer controlled software.  
3. Analysis software should be supplied with unlimited user license.  
4. Instrument should be able to read at least 16 low volume samples of 2µl-10µl 
using low volume analysis plate in case of DNA/ RNA purity & concentration 
check indirectly with standalone mode. 
5. System should be able to run in stand-alone mode using 7 inch or more touch 
screen for quick usage.  
6. The instrument should have a memory of 90 or more inbuilt protocols in stand-
alone mode.  
7. The system should have communication options, at-least 4 USB ports to PC/ 
printer and other data transfer devices and 1 ethernet port. Should be able to 
connect Wi-Fi dongle. 
8. The system should have facility to access data via cloud-based capabilities, 
wired or wireless network connection. 
9. Instrument should be able to provide the wavelength range from 200nm to 
1000nm with 1 nm steps.   
10. Performance specifications should be as: Bandwidth:  < 2.5 nm or better and 
Xenon flash lamp life should be for 10 million 96 well microplates or more.  
11. The instrument should have inbuilt incubation and linear shaking options for 
longer kinetic assays etc. 
12. Incubation temperature should be from ambient +2o C to +45o C. 
13. Spectral scanning speed from 200 to 1000 nm should be 10 sec. or less.  
14. Measurement speed should be 6 sec. for 96 well and 10 sec. for 384 well plate. 
15. System should have power save function for reduced energy consumption when 
the instrument is ‘on’ but not in use.  
16. Visualize data in both numerical mode and heat-map/ virtual image of plate. 
17. Data analysis software should be provided with the system & software should 
allow multiple absorbance /photometry steps in a single program to 
differentially analyse assays, including plate out option during the program to 
add required compounds and then continue the program for further analysis. 
18. Should be database-based software to run backups of all data & restore back 
up data (in case of hardware failure of original computer).
