CRRT 
Machine 
1 Description of function 
 
1.1 
CRRT is indicated in any patient who meets criteria for 
Haemodialysis therapy but cannot tolerate intermittent dialysis 
due to hemodynamic instability. CRRT is better tolerated by 
hemodynamically unstable patients 
because fluid volume, electrolytes and pH are adjusted slowly 
and steadily overa 24 hour period rather than a 3– 4 hour 
period. 
2 The system shall be capable of providing the following therapies:-  
 
2.1 Slow Continuous Ultrafiltration (SCUF)    
 
2.2 Continuous Venovenous Hemofiltration (CVVH)    
 
2.3 High-volume Continuous Venovenous Hemofiltration (HV-
CVVH)    
 
2.4 Continuous Venovenous Hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF)    
 
2.5 Continuous Venovenous Hemodialysis (CVVHD)    
 
2.6 Membrane Plasma Separation (MPS)    
 
2.7 Hemoperfusion (HP) 
3 The system should contain four pumps to control the flow rates of 
Blood, Filtrate, Substituate and Dialysate.    
4 
The system should contain integrated syringe pump incorporated in 
the extracorporeal blood circuit to permit continuous heparinization 
of the blood.    
5 The system should contain two integrated ceramic heaters to prevent 
loss of patient body heat after prolonged treatment. 
6 
The system should contain four precision and stable scales for the 
monitoring of the volumes of the total filtrate, Substituate and 
dialysis. Each scale Maximum loading capacity: 12 kg. 
7 The system should avoid ECG interference 
8 The system should be allowing the customer to select post or pre 
dilution on CVVH & HV-CVVH therapies. 
9 Graphical User Interface 
 
9.1 Keyboard function keys are provided.

adaptively to the illumination of the 
environment. 
 
9.3 
The keyboard function keys and LCD 
color display can provide an immediate 
overview of the machine status for 
treatment supervision.  A number of 
treatment parameters can be shown upon 
different pop-up menus:- 
 
 
9.3.1. Cumulative graphical display of 
treatment data and physiological trends 
including Pressure graphics.    
 
 
9.3.2. There are 6 selectable programming 
masks for major treatment and 
maintenance settings:
