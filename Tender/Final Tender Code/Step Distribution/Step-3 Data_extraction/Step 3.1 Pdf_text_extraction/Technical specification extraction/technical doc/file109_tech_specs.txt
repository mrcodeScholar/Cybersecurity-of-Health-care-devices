General Specification- 
Modular Frames- 
 
1. Frames shall be available in nominal heights of 38", 54‚Äù, 70", and 
86" and widths of 2' to 4' in 6-inch increments.  To accommodate 
the wheelchair patient the frame shall be designed to provide for a 
work surface height from 29 to 34 inches on 1-inch increments. 
Work surface should be at a continuous height from inside to 
outside with a minimum six (6) inch overhang on the exterior. 
2. Frames shall be constructed of a minimum of 16-gauge steel 
tubing with a nominal 2" X 2" cross section to insure structural 
integrity and safety and shall have plastic floor glides which will 
adjust vertically at least 1" to accommodate floor variance. They 
shall be designed in such a fashion to permit all hanging 
components (work surfaces and shelves) to be adjusted in 1-inch 
vertical increments.  All hanging components must, by design, 
have an anti-dislodgment feature. Each frame shall have hinged 
injection-molded or similar extruded PVC wire management 
baseboard covers accessible on both sides which shall provide 
locations for electrical outlets and an enclosed raceway for the 
non-electrical.  The hinged covers shall allow for the laying in of 
non-electrical and eliminate the need to thread wires through the 
base of the frame and around the corners. 
3. Frames shall be firmly secured with metal connectors to one 
another quickly using a simple hand tool (i.e. screwdriver or 
wrench) and shall allow for a two-way 90-degree, two-way 
135-degree, three-way, four-way or straight line configurations.  
Frames shall be secured so that light is not transmitted through the 
connectors. 
4. Frames shall be designed to accept at least eight duplex 
receptacles per frame. A four foot wide by 38" frame must; 
however, accommodate at least eight duplex receptacles.  The 
frames shall have the capability of being wired with two modular 
eight-wire, four 20-amp circuit electrical distribution systems of 
which one circuit shall have the capability of being a completely 
dedicated circuit.  The receptacles shall be located at the baseline, 
vertically every 8 inches, and work surface level.  The entire 
system must be UL listed. Please refer to the equipment and 
electrical drawings for specific requirements. 
5. The frames shall also have the capability of receiving a hard wired 
(using 3/8" type MC aluminum cabling) solution with hospital 
grade receptacles.  The frames must accommodate both emergency 
and non-emergency power in the same frame. The receptacles 
shall be accessible at the baseline, vertically every 8 inches, and at 
08

baseline and work surface levels. 
7. Frames shall be designed to accept various sizes of access panels 
with different finishes and perform different functions.

storage units. 
11. Frames shall be capable of receiving a rail to provide horizontal 
interface capability for large storage units and drawer storage 
units. Adapting horizontal rail shall be adjustable vertically in 1" 
or less increments and shall be made of steel or extruded 
aluminum. 
12. (A stacking frame shall be available which will increase the height 
of an existing frame by a nominal 16" without removing the frame 
from adjacent componentry.   The stacking frame shall be 
constructed of a minimum of 16 gauge steel and shall be load 
bearing. 
13. Frames shall be available with pre-attached baseline junction 
boxes for hard wiring to decrease electrical installation time. 
b. Access Panels  
1. Access panels shall close off the interior and exterior chase of the 
modular open frame, and shall be available in several sizes and 
variations to allow maximum accommodation of the nurse station's 
requirements. 
2. Access panels shall be available in plastic covered, tool-
supporting, fabric covered, marker board, tackable, open pass-
through, and beltline wire management. Access panels for the 
wheelchair access module shall be fabricated from high-pressure 
.05 inch plastic laminate over 7/8-inch particle board core with hpl 
backer board on the underneath side.  Access panels shall also be 
available that have a finish that is produced by using the Powder 
Coated Process (epoxy resin paint with a metal substrate). 
3. Access panel shall be easily removed without the need for tools 
and permit nurse station equipment to be serviced from the outside
