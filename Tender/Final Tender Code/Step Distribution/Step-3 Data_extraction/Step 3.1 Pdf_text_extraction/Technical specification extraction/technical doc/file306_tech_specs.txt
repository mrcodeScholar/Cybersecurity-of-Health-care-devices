Storage Space/Server For Daily Remote Incremental Backup In Different 
Seismic Zone 
 
 
 
Backup (External) 6 TB (At Remote Location and Server) - Backup for 
each server should be two to three times the HDD capacity since this is a 
critical application and backup should be maintained in a different conti-
nent/seismic zone.
