8. Computerized Stabilometry Balance Platform(Posturography) Model STP:- 
Stabilometry is an objective and functional evaluation of the postural control system in its 
steady-state behavior. It is also a very good evaluation tool to measure the outcome of vestibular 
rehabilitation. 
It consists of the following tests – 
● SET 
It assesses functional balance control based on the patient’s postural sway velocity during 
four testing conditions. Results are presented in graphical form. 
● Limits of Stability (LOS) 
It quantifies the maximum distance the patient can intentionally displace their COG in the 
different directions and maintain stability at those positions. Measured parameters are

reaction time, COG movement velocity, directional control, end-point excursion, and 
maximum excursion. 
● Rhythmic Weight Shift (RWS) 
It quantifies the patient’s ability to rhythmically move their COG from left to right and 
forward to backward between two targets at different speeds. The measured parameters 
are the on-axis COG velocity and directional control.
