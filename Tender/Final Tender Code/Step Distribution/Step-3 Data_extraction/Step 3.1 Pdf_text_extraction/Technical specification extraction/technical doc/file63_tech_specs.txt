The DICOM 3 interface shall be installed to the system 
in order to allow the surgeon to view all the DICOM 3 
images stored in the PACS system on a digital light 
box within the operating rooms. Furthermore, all intra 
operative images recorded can be sent via the DICOM 
3 interface to the PACS system for further processing.

Signal management system 
A compact solution enables the easy and efficient 
distribution and individual routing 
of several high-resolution video signals, even without 
an integrated OR. 
The HD Video Router shall be a Medical-Grade video 
routing system that accepts up to 4 DVI-D (2D & 3D 
signals) inputs and 4 DVI-D (2D & 3D signals) 
outputs. This shall be utilized to connect various 
imaging devices such as the Endoscopic Camera, 
Surgical Camera, Room Camera, Surgical Displays, 
etc.  
Routing the desired input to the desired output shall be 
possible via 4 membrane buttons on front panel. 
In addition, this system should be able to also operate 
as a distributor in that any of the selected inputs is 
simultaneously broadcasted over the 4 outputs at the 
push of a button.
