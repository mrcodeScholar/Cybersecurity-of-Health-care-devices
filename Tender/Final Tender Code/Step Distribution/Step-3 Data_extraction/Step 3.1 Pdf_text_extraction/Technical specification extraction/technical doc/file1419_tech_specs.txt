RFID Tags - Books 
The RFID chip used in the 
tag should have been 
designed specifically for 
Library use. i.e. it should 
have three sections 
◦ Lockable section for item 
identification  
◦ Re-writable section for 
library-specific use  
◦ Security function (EAS) 
for item anti-theft (which 
can be activated and 
deactivated),  
◦ The RFID chip should 
have multi-read function, 
i.e. several tags can be read 
at the same time. 
Tag size should be 80mm x 
50mm with at least 2048 
bits of memory, multi-read 
and antitheft 
Distance for detection from 
the pedestal should be a
