Computerized 
dental occlusal 
analysis 
system 
1. The unit should provide data that allow dentists to better 
evaluate and assess occlusion via detecting simultaneous 
contact with quantify time and force. 
2. The system should quickly and precisely determines the 
amount of force within a given paper mark and software 
graphically displays both forceful and time premature contacts 
to the user for predictable occlusal control during adjustment 
procedure. 
3. The system should consists of: 
a) Flexible and disposable ultra-thin sensor on which patient 
bite down for evaluating the various parameters of occlusion. 
b) Windows based software, which measures intra-oral force 
in time increments as low as 0.01 seconds and display this 
information in 2-D and 3-D as a continuous force movie. It 
should be possible to record entire occlusal contact event for 
dynamic playback. 
c) The System should provide dynamic feedback on the 
Occlusal force, time of occlusion and disclusion. 
4.  The system should also produce documentation showing pre & 
post-procedure result. 
5.  It should be easy to move USB based sensor from one PC to 
another.
