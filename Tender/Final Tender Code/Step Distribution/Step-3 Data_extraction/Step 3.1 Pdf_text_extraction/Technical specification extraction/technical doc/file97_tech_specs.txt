Six Part 
Haematolog
y Cell 
Counter  
 
1. The instrument should be fully automated fluorescence flow 
cytometry based 6-part differential haematology analyzer offering 
automatic start-up, shutdown and sample-analysis.  
2. The instrument should have random access discrete analysis modes 
for a) CBC, CBC+DIFFERENTIAL+ IG.  
3. The instrument should have 24 PARAMETERS reported:  
a) Wbc, RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC,RDW-SD, RDW-CV , 
PLT, NEUT %, LYMPH %, MONO%, EOS %, BASO %, NEUT #, 
LYMPH #, MONO #, EOS #, BASO #, PDW, MPV, PCT, P-LCR, IG 
#, IG %  
b) TWO HISTOGRAMS - RBC, PLT and ONE SCATTERGRAM  
4. The instrument should have throughput of atleast 60 samples per hour 
in both the discrete analysis modes.  
5. The sample aspiration volume for the complete differential blood 
count should not be more than 50 [1.1.  
6 The instrument should have the following analysis modes, Manual - 
Open, Capillary mode and Sampler mode  
7. The instrument should have Hydrodynamic focusing / impedance 
method for RBC/PLT channel  
8. The instrument should have Cyanide free Sls-hb /colorimetric method 
for the hemoglobin measurement  
9. The instrument should be equipped with Fluorescence based 
semiconductor laser fluorescence flow cytometry for Differential 
channel.  
10. Instrument should be able to enumerate immature granulocytes  
11. Instrument should be equipped with automatic rerun/reflex modes  
12. Instrument should have facility for upgradation with additional 
clinical parameters like reticulocytes, immature platelet fraction etc  
13. Analyser must have option to enumerate differentials for body fluid 
samples  
14. Instrument should have options for autosampler & integrated 
barcode reader  
15. The instrument should have COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION 
PROCESSING SYSTEM with  
a) User-friendly Windows XP/ 7 based software.  
b) 100000 sample data with histogram and scattergrams storage.  
c) 99 QC files each with 300 points for QC can be stored.  
16. The instrument should have minimum maintenance Semiconductor 
laser should have lower power consumption, higher stability, and longer 
life thus cutting down on maintenance cost.  
17. The instrument should be EXTENSIVE QC FEATURES:  
a) Min one file for X bar M.  
b) Delta checks available for cumulative review.  
c) Option for online QC also available.
