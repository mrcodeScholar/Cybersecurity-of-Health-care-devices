Spirometer 
 
A computerized impulse oscillometer which also include spirometer and 
diffusion measurement apparatus is required for Pediatrics Department.  
 
1) Operational Requirements  
1.1). The parameters should be actually measured and not derived ones. 
1.2) The system should be an economically oriented lung function 
measuring system for the determination of the static and dynamic lung 
volumes using the classical FRC-Helium rebreathing and the Diffusion 
Capacity by using the single Breath technique. It should also be possible 
to measure Diffusion Capacity (DLCO) by the Rebreathing/ Intrabreath 
technique for patients with distribution impairments of the lungs, to 
minimize patient co-operation. 
1.3) Indian predictive values should be available for all measurement 
and both methods of estimation of lung diffusion. The proper medical 
reference from where these values have been incorporated should be 
clearly mentioned. 
 
2) Technical Specification 
2.1) The system should measure the following: 
a) Slow and forced spirometry (Inspiratory and Expiratory Flow 
Volume Curve) 
b) Lung sub volumes - Functional Residual Capacity (FRC) Residual 
Volume (RV). Total lung capacity (TLC) by FRC-Helium multiple 
breath technique. 
c) Diffusion capacity of the lung, by single breath technique. 
d) Diffusion capacity of the lung by the multiple breath technique. 
e) Respiratory impedance & small airway obstruction by Impulse 
Oscillometry requiring minimal patient co-operation. 
 
2.2) The system should measure the following parameters: 
a) Slow and forced Spirometry VT, BF, MV, ERV, FVC, FEV1, VCin, 
VCex, MEF 50, MEF 75, PEF, MVV etc. 
b) Lung Sub volumes: FRC, RV, TLC, RV%TLC etc. 
c) Diffusion capacity of the lungs: DLCO-SB, DLCO-RB. 
d) Impedance at specific frequencies like R5, R20 + -1 Hz should be 
demonstrated. 
 
2.3) The system should have an easy to exchange, bidirectional 
heated pneumotach with the following specifications: 
Range-Should be 0 to 20 lit/sec 
Accuracy – Should be +/-2% 
Resistance – Should be less than 0.05 KPa/lit/sec 
 
2.4) The system should have carbon monoxide analyzer, He 
analyzer and O2 Analyzer or any other suitable gas analyzer with 
the following specifications: 
01

Range-Should be from 0 to 0.4% 
Resolution/Accuracy should be 0.0002%/0.0003% 
Reproducibility should be 0.0006% 
 
b) He analyzer : 
Range – Should be 0 to 9.5% 
Resolution / Accuracy should be 0.05% / 1.0%  
Reproducibility should be 0.1% 
c) 02 analyzer : 
Range – Should be 0 to 100% 
Resolution / Accuracy should be 0.05% / 1.0%  
Reproducibility should be 0.1% 
2.5) The system should have a demand valve unit for direct breathing 
(no inspiratory bag) from pre-mix gas container, to minimize wastage of 
gas. 
 
2.6) The computer system should have the following specification: 
Latest Pentium processer, 8GB RAM, 19” LCD Monitor with inbuilt 
Speakers, wireless keyboard and mouse, 01 TB HDD, Dual layer DVD 
writer based on latest Window Software, Color laser printer & 1.5 KVA 
UPS with battery backup of at least 15 minutes. 
 
2.7) System software should have facility for entry of patient data and 
saving of this information in a data base system. Software should be 
based on latest MS-windows. It should be possible to configure different 
report output formats. 
 
2.8) It should be possible to upgrade the system to the following: 
a) Airway resistance by shutter method. 
b) Respiratory muscle strength, Respiratory drive. 
c) Compliance – Static / Dynamic system  
d) Body Plethysmography 
e) Aerosol Provocation system 
f) Ergospirometry & stress test ECG. 
g) Breathing Analysis for children. 
 
2.9) The system should have fully computerized calibration procedure 
for flow sensor and gas analyzers. The system should also have a check 
procedure during start-up. 
 
2.10) It should be possible to integrate/connect the system in a local 
Area Network (LAN). The data base must be accessed in a novel 
authorized operating system. 
 
3) Spares and consumables 
1. Disposable filters (paed.) with mouth pieces – 1000 nos 
2. If pneumotach uses wire mesh – 10 wire mesh
