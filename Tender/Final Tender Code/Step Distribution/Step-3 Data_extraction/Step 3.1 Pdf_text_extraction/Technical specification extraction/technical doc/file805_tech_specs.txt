Mandatory Ventilation (A/C ): SIMV; CPAP; Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV); APRV, DuoPAP / 
BiPAP / BiPhasic; , Combination / Dual modes like PRVC / APV or VAPS/automode/autoflow; 
Apnea Back -up and any other mode for safe ventilations offering both volume guarantee & lung 
protective strategies like volume limit etc. 
It should have one of the advanced ventilation modes like NAVA/ASV/PAV/Bilevel VG/ Smartcare 
as standard.
