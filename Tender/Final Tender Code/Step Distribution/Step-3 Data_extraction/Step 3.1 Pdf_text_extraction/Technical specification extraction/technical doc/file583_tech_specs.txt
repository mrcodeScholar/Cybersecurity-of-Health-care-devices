Rotational 
Thrombo 
Elastometry 
The product is the proprietary item of the company TEM (The 
proprietary certificate enclosed.) 
 
Whole Blood Haemostasis System using Rotational Thrombo 
Elastography as measuring principle for in-vitro diagnostics in the 
POC (Point of Care). The machine should have: 
 
S.No. 
Component 
1 
Four independent channels tempered to 37 +/- 1.0 degree 
centigrade (default physiologic temperature) to 
i) Shorten the reaction time relevantly 
ii) Increase the precision 
iii) Inhibit certain factors (Heparin) 
iv) Allow differentiation between Fibrin and Platelet 
contributions to the overall clot 
v) Allow simultaneous use for multiple patients 
The work area should serve as a preheating station for cup 
holders and additionally to contain a sample preheating 
station. 
It should have a measuring cell ejector. 
2 
Seventeen inches touch screen monitor for easy handling 
and to give simultaneous results for all 6 (4+2) channels 
3 
Barcode reader to scan samples, single use reagents as 
well as quality controls 
4 
Electronic pipette: Software controlled pipetting and 
mixing of liquids  
5 
Should have Pipette and clean ring rod holder with pipette 
cable guide, Pipette socket 
6 
Should have Guiding rods and rails to guide the cup 
holder and to ensure the proper positioning of the cup 
under the axis 
7 
MC rod holder to hold the MC Rod pro 
8 
Curve smoothing algorithm  and noise filter to prevent 
errors due to mechanical or electronic noise 
9 
Reagent Jack to hold the reagents during measurement 
10 
Keyboard with integrated trackball connected to one of the 
4 USB slots in the rear side of the instrument 
11 
Additional USB port for data backup 
12 
Internal hard disk memory: 500 GB memory 
 
Quality Controls: To be done on alternate weeks with INTEM and 
EXTEM with Rotrol N and Rotrol P for one year by the supplier. Cost 
of Q & C is to be mentioned separately. 
 
Reagents: 10 Vials each for: Intem, Rextem, Fibtem, Heptem and 
Startem to be supplied. Cost of reagents to be mentioned separately
