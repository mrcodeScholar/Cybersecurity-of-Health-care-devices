F. No. 21-06/LM/AKM/2015-16 
 
Name of the Item: Three part Hematology Cell counter 
1. Should be fully Automated three part Haematology Analyzer providing at least 16 
parameters including a 3 part differential. 
2. The system should give a % count for Lymphocyte and granulocytes. 
3. Throughput: System should be capable of processing samples at least 60 
samples/hour. 
4. The system should be based upon direct current detection method with coincidence 
correction or electrical impedance based or lysis based for differentiation of three part 
differential, RBC count and platelet counts  
5. System should have auto cleaning mechanism for sample probe to avoid 
contamination.  
6. The system should use non cyanide based reagents for Hb estimation with automatic 
blanking.  
7. Must have floating threshold to separate overlapping of platelet & RBCs. 
8. System should have possibility to perform automatic and manual mode of calibration. 
9. Minimum sample volume required for analysis should be 10ul – 50ul 
10. Should give various useful pathological flags for abnormal results 
11. Precision must be as WBC< 2.5% , RBC< 2 % , PLT < 5 % 
12. System should have bidirectional interfacing option available With LIS & HIS 
compatibility. Should have built in port to attach hand held bar code scanner 
13. System should be user friendly with colour touch screen or keypad operation and 
should have option for inbuilt/ external printer as well as data inter facing.  
14. System should be US FDA / CE certified. The manufacturing certificate of the model 
should   be provided. 
15. The Firm  must have  their own manufactured  quality controls and calibrators 
16. Online UPS with 60 min back up should be supplied with the instrument. .

17. System should have inbuilt memory to save minimum 1000 results with histogram 
and should have option to store data in external USB drive 
18. The system should be equipped with shortest fluidics in order to minimize 
maintenance  
19. Linearity : 
i. 
WBC:  0.0 to 100000/ ul 
ii. 
RBC:   0 to 7million/ul 
iii. 
Hb   :   0 to 26 g% 
iv. 
Hct  :     05 to 60 % 
v. 
Platelet: 10000-1000000/ul 
20. Reagent Consumption: The firm should mention each reagent consumption in ml as 
i. 
Start Up cycle consumption (For each regent used Such as Diluent, Lyse, 
Cleaner etc.) 
ii. 
Shut-Down cycle consumption (For each regent used Such as Diluent, Lyse, 
Cleaner etc.) 
iii. 
Per sample cycle (For each regent used Such as Diluent, Lyse, Cleaner etc.) 
21. Warranty for 5 years & CMC price for next 5 years, which should include cost of 
labour spares, entire equipment.  
22. The Firm should provide price for all the reagents and consumables required for next 
5 years. 
23. Overall reagent consumption will be taken into consideration while technical 
evaluation of instrument 
24. Tender evaluation would be done taking into account the cost of the equipment, cost 
of calibrators and controls (control frequency 3 level control/ day) and cost of 
reagents for minimum 20000 tests per annum.  
 
                Specifications are broad based and generalised and does not suit any particular 
firm.
