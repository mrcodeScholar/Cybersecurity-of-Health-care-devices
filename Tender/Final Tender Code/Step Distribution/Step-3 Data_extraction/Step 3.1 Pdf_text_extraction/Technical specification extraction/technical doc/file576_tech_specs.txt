ometer  
1. 
A spectral scanning unit for UV-visible-Near-IR wavelength range, 
with dedicated cuvette port (with no extra attachments) and should 
able to read 96 and 384-microwell plate format and micro-volume 
plate. 
2. 
Should be able to work with both compute- controlled software and 
in standalone mode without computer, using at least 7-inch touch 
screen.  
3. 
Analysis software should be supplied with unlimited user license.  
4. 
Should be able to read end-point, kinetics, spectral scanning and 
kinetic spectral scan.  
5. 
Should able to read at least 16 low volume samples of 2µl-10µl 
using low volume analysis plate for DNA/RNA purity and 
concentration check directly with its standalone mode. 
6. 
Should have a memory of 99 inbuilt protocols, in stand-alone mode. 
7. 
At least two USB data ports in instrument, one for Wi-fi dongle and 
one for data transfer device, 1 Ethernet port for communication. 
8. 
Operator should be able to access data via cloud-based capability, 
wired/wireless network connection.  
9. 
Able to provide the wavelength range from 200nm to 1000nm with 
1nm steps.   
10. 
Spectral scanning speed of 10 seconds from 200 to 1000 nm with 
1nm steps per sample. 
11. 
Measurement speed should be 6 seconds for 96 well plate and 10 
seconds for 384 well plate. 
12. 
Performance Specifications: Bandwidth: < 2.5 nm or better and 
Xenon flash lamp life should be for 10 million 96 well microplates.  
13. 
For longer kinetic assays, an inbuilt incubation and linear shaking 
option should be provided. 
14. 
Incubation temperature: from ambient +2 0C to +45 0C. 
15. 
Should have Power Save function when the instrument is ‘ON’ but 
not being used.  
16. 
Visualize data in both numerical mode and heat-map/virtual image 
of plate.  
Data Analysis Software: 
 
1. 
Should allow multiple absorbance /photometry steps in a single 
program for differential analysis assays. 
2. 
Should have a plate-out option during the program run for addition 
of compounds and should be able to continue the program in 
continuous mode.  
3. 
Should allow multiple absorbance reading steps within the same 
program. 
4. 
Should be provided with a database-based software to run and 
restore back up data etc. 
5. 
Should have area selection option, for different measuring 
parameters for different area in a same plate.  
6. 
Should have a single graph plot for Spectral scanning of all 96 
samples or 384 samples.  
7. 
Data export should be in pdf, Excel, xml and note formats.
