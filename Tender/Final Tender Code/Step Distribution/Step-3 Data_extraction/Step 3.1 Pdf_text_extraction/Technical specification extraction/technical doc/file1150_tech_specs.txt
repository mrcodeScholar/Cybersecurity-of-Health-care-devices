Comments 
Usability of any other application apart from our dedicated software should 
lead to malfunction of the entire system. This should be treated as a security 
breach by the system itself and should be reported immediately to the nodal 
center.

Note - The whole system should be dedicated and it should be integrated with all the E round devices which are 
shown in the hardware requirements attached with this software requirement sheet. The ECG device should be 
enabled through comport data sharing structure. The oximetry device and the temperature device should be 
integrated through the comport data sharing structure.  
Additional features: 
 
At Hub 
At Spoke 
For Doctors 
Data analytical platform: 
The hub should be aware of how 
many cases have been treated 
through the e-round facility. With a 
detailed structure of gender, age, 
weight, medical history, medicines, 
Paediatric triangle, paediatric 
pentagon and other important data 
which can be modified as per 
requirements. 
Dedicated telemedicine  platform: 
The spokes should have a dedicated 
Telemedicine software which should 
be integrated with all the devices 
required in the hardware section and 
should provide data in real-time 
including admission and monitoring 
forms for pediatric patients. 
Dedicated telemedicine  mobile and 
web application: 
The doctor should be able to assess 
the patient through the mobile 
application for ease of application of 
the e round facility, The doctor 
should also have access to our web 
application through which he/she 
can assess the patient from a big 
screen device like laptop or pc. 
Google Chrome browser should be 
treated as the primary browser. 
 
Triaging and assessment tools 
Triaging software/ 
application for 
children 
Risk assessment on the basis of Pediatric triangle: 
 
Level 1 (Resuscitation): 
Patients requiring immediate intervention to maintain physiological stability and 
continuous monitoring; e.g., severe respiratory distress, respiratory failure, shock or 
cardiopulmonary failure/arrest, unconsciousness, seizures, major burns, significant 
bleeding and severe trauma. 
 
Level 2 (Emergent): Any physiologically unstable patient with moderate respiratory 
distress, altered sensorium (GSS<13), severe dehydration, and fever. Patients requiring 
comprehensive assessment and multiple interventions to prevent further deterioration, 
e.g., sepsis, toxic ingestion/overdose, severe asthma, seizure (post-ictal), DKA, purpuric

rash, severe testicular pain, lacerations, dental injury with an avulsed permanent tooth, 
violent patients and child abuse with ongoing risk.  
Level 3 (Urgent): Patient who is alert, oriented, well hydrated, minor alterations in vital 
signs, febrile child >3 months and mild respiratory distress.  
 
Level 4 (Less Urgent): Patient who is alert, oriented, and may have a condition that 
causes distress and may progress with development of complications, e.g., vomiting / 
diarrhea without dehydration in a child >2 yrs., fever and simple complaints such as ear 
pain, sore throat or nasal congestion, simple lacerations/ Sprains/ Strains, or head 
trauma with no symptoms. 
 
Level 5 (Non-Urgent): Patient who is febrile, alert, oriented, well hydrated, with normal 
vital signs. Interventions required are usually not other than assessment/ discharge 
instruction. These patients may be referred to outpatient department (OP) or 
community healthcare system for management

● Stable 
● Respiratory Distress 
● Respiratory Failure
