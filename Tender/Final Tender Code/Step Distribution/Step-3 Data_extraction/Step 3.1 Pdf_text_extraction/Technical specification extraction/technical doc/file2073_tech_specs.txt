Item: Near infra-red spectroscopy (NIRS) system  
Specification: 
1. Near infra-red spectroscopy system is a monitor to measure cerebral/somatic oximetry  
2. NIRS technology is used to detect changes in regional blood oxygen saturation (rSO2) in the 
brain and skeletal muscles (somatic) tissue of the body. 
3. The equipment should be non-invasive and can be used safely in neonates 
4. Monitors must have provision of 4 channels capable of monitoring two tissue sites 
concentrations simultaneously. 
5. Monitor should measure regional oxygen saturations in the range of rSO2 15-95. Values must 
be updated at regular intervals typically every 5 seconds or less. 
6. Must comply with biomedical safety standards of the USFDA/European CE/ISO/BIS. 
7. System should meet all international regulatory standards like EN 60601-1 
8. Should be user friendly with pre-calibration and ready to use in 30 seconds 
9. Sensors self-calibration automatically by system 
10. Should be able to perform automatic self-test. 
11. Monitor should be applicable to neonatal patients in any clinical setting where the brain and 
body are at risk of reduced-flow or no-flow ischemic states. 
12. Accuracy for reading must be within ± 5 rSO2 unit of actual. Repeatability must be ± 1-2 
rSO2 units. 
13. Power requirement: 100-240 VAC, 50/60 Hz, 1.0A – 0.5A with connects for external AC 
mains and battery backup of approximately 20 minutes 
14. Trend memory of 24 hours at 2 samples per minute with maximum of 28 cases saved
