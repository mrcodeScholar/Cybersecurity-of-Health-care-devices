15. Automatic oil dispenser.  
16. Automatic image capture under oil immersion objective. 
(c) Karyotype software: 
1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)/ DNN (Deep Neural Network) enhanced flexible karyotyping 
(chromosomal assignment, chromosomal orientation, removal of non-chromosomal objects and 
background reduction), available for all common human samples and banding patterns.  
2. User defined automated and assisted complete workflows 
3. Whole metaphase separation, including overlapping, touching and clustered chromosomes.  
4. After metaphase finding and high-resolution image capture, system should automatically karyotype 
metaphases without human intervention.  
5. Unlimited undo and log operations to overcome human errors.  
6. Interactive and automatic Classification based on built-in classifiers for G-, Q- and R-banding. 
7. Ideograms according to ISCN standard for 400, 550, and 850 bands.  
 (d) FISH Software:  
1. Image acquisition in up to 12 color channels with integrated microscope control for motorized 
microscopes.  
2. Extended focus image generation to have a very clear Fluorescence signal against clear dark 
background. User defined automatic processing functions significantly simplify the image 
enhancement immediately after the capture.
