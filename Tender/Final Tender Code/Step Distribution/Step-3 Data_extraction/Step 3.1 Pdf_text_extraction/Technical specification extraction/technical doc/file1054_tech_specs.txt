Microscope 
1) Inverted Frame: Motorized Ergonomic Stand with inbuilt Z-focus 
drive with minimum step resolution of 10-15 nm or better. The system 
should have a dedicated external TFT/LCD touch screen capable of 
controlling all motorized functions of microscope. The system should 
have an IR based Laser/LED focus drift compensator for long term in 
focus time lapse imaging controlled by both touch screen panel and 
imaging software at all magnifications.  
2) Transmitted Light system: 12V100W Halogen Illumination with 
intensity control through touch panel and imaging software  
3) Condenser: Motorized Universal Condenser (suitable for all 
microscopy techniques such as Phase, DIC) with 6 to 7 slots. It should 
have Phase rings for 10X, 20X, 40X and DIC prisms for 20X, 40X and 
60X and 100X objectives. Automatic detection of phase ring.  
4) Eyepiece: 10X with F.O.V 22mm or better eye pieces-2 nos.  
5) Nosepiece: Six positions motorized revolving nosepiece with Slot for 
DIC 
Slider/analyzer 
to 
accommodate 
objectives 
of 
different 
magnifications. 
6) Stage: Motorized X-Y Stage with multi-site scanning capability, 
controller and joystick having multiple holders to adapt. The motorized 
stage should be able hold CO2 incubator with stage inserts for 35 mm 
plates, 96 Well plates, and Slides. The imaging software should have 
modules to drive the motorized stage and perform multi well/multipoint 
imaging and mosaic imaging (Image stitching).  
7) Objectives: High numerical aperture objectives suitable for bright field/ 
fluorescence/ DIC observation. Plan fluorite 10X with phase, Plan flour 
long working distance objective 20X phase with correction collar, long 
working distance plan flour objective 40X phase with correction collar 
& fluorescence, High NA Confocal grade plan apochromat objective 
60X with oil (N.A 1.35 or higher UV-IR Corrected), plan Apochromat 
100X with oil (N.A 1.40 or higher UV-IR Corrected)  
8) Fluorescence Module: Motorized fluorescence attachment with built in 
shutter and a minimum of 6-8 position filter cube slots for band pass 
(Excitation and Emission) interference fluorescent filters FITC/GFP 
(Ex465-495, DM 505), TRITC/Rhodamine (Ex 540/25, DM 565,) 
DAPI/Hoechst (Ex 340-380, DM 400), separate florescence filter for 
YFP, CFP and Cy5 application should be quoted.  
9) Fluorescence Light Source: Fluorescence Light Source 120/130 watts 
metal halide/Mercury lamp with 2000hrs life time (quote 5 spare bulbs) 
with Light intensity control. The light source should be alignment 
free/pre-centered to minimize human interference for alignment. The 
light source should be connected to the microscope with fiber (3m) to 
avoid direct heat transfer from the Mercury/metal halide lamp. The 
shutter and the attenuator for the light source be controlled & 
synchronized by imaging software for time lapse and multi-channel 
imaging. It should also be controlled by touch screen and software. 
10)  Camera:  
(i) A 2/3 inch pettier cooled 12.5 MP colour scientific CCD camera 
with minimum of 15 FPS for high resolution color imaging and  
(ii) 2/3 inch 1360x1024 1.4 MP, 6.45 um pixel, 14bit monochrome 
camera cooled to-10 deg for high sensitive fluorescence live cell 
imaging should be quoted.

A facility to image both color and fluorescence imaging in sequential 
mode for HNE and fluorescence image with super imposition should be 
a part of the microscope. The switching of monochrome and color 
camera to be done through motorized switching between cameras with 
100% light distribution in both cameras for sequential imaging of 
monochrome (fluorescence) and color (HNE) imaging.The bidders can 
quote for single or two independent cameras meeting all above 
specifications.  
11) Software: 
The 
imaging 
software 
should 
have 
an 
advance 
multidimensional acquisition, camera control and controlling all 
function of motorized and coded functions of microscope. It should 
have automated count & measurement modules, time lapse recording 
functions, automated five dimension imaging, automated multi-channel 
fluorescence capturing and merging , fluorescence unmixing, co-
localization, wide Field basic De-convolution software module . Quote 
for 3D Blind deconvolution module in option. The software should 
have function of automated Multi Point/multi well time Lapse Imaging.  
Branded Data processing unit with i5/i7 Xenon processor with 8 GB 
RAM, DVD Writer, 1TB or higher HDD, 1280x1024 (min. 1024
