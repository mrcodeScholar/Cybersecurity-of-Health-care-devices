Cat No 
Item description 
186-4004 QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System  
Includes droplet generator, droplet reader, software, associated component consumables. 
• Bio-Rad's QX200 ddPCR System combines water-oil emulsion droplet technology with 
microfluidics. 
• It provides a measure of target DNA molecules with unrivalled precision, accuracy, and 
sensitivity. 
• The system partitions each sample into 20,000 uniform nanolitre droplets containing target 
and background DNA in a random distribution. 
• Each droplet serves to partition the reactions. 
• Droplets are transferred to a 96 well PCR plate and PCR is performed to end point in a 
thermal cycler. 
• The droplets stream single file through the reader for fluorescence analysis. 
• Positive droplets, which contain at least one copy of the target DNA or RNA molecule, 
exhibit increased fluorescence compared to negative droplets. 
• The fraction of PCR-positive partitions enables the target to be quantified according to the 
Poisson distribution. 
QX200 Droplet Generator 
• Starting sample size: 20ul 
• Capacity: 1-8 samples / cartridge 
• Droplets per sample: 20,000
