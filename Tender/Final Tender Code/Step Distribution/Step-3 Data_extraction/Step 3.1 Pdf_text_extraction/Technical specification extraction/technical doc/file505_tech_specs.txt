USG Machine 
for Urological 
Procedure 
A. 
Should have High Resolution Imaging for Clinical Needs 
B. 
Should have a 19” flat panel monitor 
C. 
Should have speckle reduction technology for enhancing tissue 
margins for better anatomical visualization and to improve 
better organ anatomy from different angles. 
D. 
Should have facility to connect at least two electronic 
Transducers 
E. 
Should have Automated Mode Adjustment for high resolution 
B mode image  
F. 
Should have facility to compensate the motion related imaging 
artifacts  
G. 
Should have DICOM Capabilities 
H. 
Transducers should have programmable start and stop buttons. 
I. 
Control panel should be sealed for easy cleaning and 
disinfection 
J. 
Control panel should be illuminated for easy access 
K. 
Should have an internal hard drive to store images. 
L. 
Should have height adjustable mechanism with control panel. 
M. 
CD /DVD writer and USB Flash memory drive should be the 
part of the system optionally. 
N. 
Should be of latest generation quad beam digital technology. 
O. 
Imaging Modes: System should have following modes: 
a.  B mode 
b.  M Mode 
c.  Color Doppler 
d.  Power Doppler 
e.  Pulsed Wave Doppler 
f.  Tissue Harmonic Imaging 
 
The following transducers are to be supplied along with the scanner: 
 
2-6MHz convex abdominal transducer with an Autoclavable 
biopsy attachment 
 
Transrectal transducer with simultaneous biplane imaging 
facility to visualize, sagittal as well as transverse planes of 
prostate gland. The same transducer should have an endfire 
array for scanning the apical areas of the prostate during nerve 
sparing lap radical prostatectomies. Transducer should 
compatible 
with 
standard 
sterilization 
methods 
like, 
immersion, ETO and Sterrad. A biopsy attachment for side fire 
as well as endfire arrays to be supplied. 
 
A laparoscopic four way deflectable transducer which can be 
used through normal laparoscopic ports (10-12 mm) with a 
biopsy facility to be supplied. Probe should be compatible with 
standard sterilization methods like immersion, ETO and 
Sterrad. Compatible biopsy attachments should be supplied. 
 
6-12 MHz multi frequency linear transducer with angle 
independent velocity measurements for vascular, small parts, 
testes, breast and thyroid scans should be quoted .System 
should be able optimize doppler parameters automatically. 
Should be able to supply a transducer compatible with daVinci robot 
for robotic assisted partial nephrectomies. 
 
Must be US FDA/European CE approved
