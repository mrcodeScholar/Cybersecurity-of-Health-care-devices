ANNEXURE-I 
DETAILED TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION FOR 
Real Time PCR Machine  
 
Technical Specification: 
 
1. Open system capable of performing both real time PCR and end point analysis. 
2. Peltier-based system.  
3. 96 well block (Compatible to both fast and standard mode with multiplexing capability). 
4. Supported volume range:10µl to 50µl. 
5. Filters (wide band) – Five-excitation filters,five-emission filters. 
6. Excitation source- LED/ Xenone.  
7. Detection: CCD/PMT/CMOS.  
8. Any periodic calibration pertaining to the optics should be taken care by the vendor at lea
next 5 years.  
9. Block ramp rate (at peak):≥ 5   C 
10. Temperature Range: 4  C- 99  C 
11. Should be factory calibrated for handling all commonly used fluorescent dyes such 
as SYBR Green, FAM, VIC, JOE, HEX, TET, NED, TAMRA, ROX, Texas 
Red,Cy3,Cy5,Quasar 670,705 etc for Real Time PCR applications for diagnosis of 
human infectious diseases and calibration for any other dye in the wavelength of 450-
730nm should be possible without any additional filter sets. 
12. Reaction should be run in the form of plate,individual tube and tube strips with 
optical flat caps. 
13. Should have feature of performing relative and absolute quantitation, Melting curve 
analysis (at high resolution),gradient/primer optimization and multiplex-PCR up to 6 
target/channels, SNP analysis, dissociation curve analysis, pathogen detection and 
plus/minus assays etc. 
14. Data Collection: 
 
Standard:Collect data for all 5 filters for all wells regardless of plate setup. Plate setup may 
altered after run completes. 
Expert: Colect datew for selected individual filter or group of filters for all wells regardless o
plate.Plate setup may be altered after run completes. 
15. Details of data acquistion during run for all dyes shuold be provided and ensured 
Temperature accuracy: Maximum (+/- 0.25  C of set point/display temperature,measured 
at 3 minutes after clock start). 
16. Run Time: ~40 min (fast mode-expert), <2 hrs (Standard ) for 40 cycles. 
17. Software should ensure minimal crosstalk when using multiple fluorophores for 
multiplex assays. 
18. Dedicated licensed full version software for primer and probe design with 
comprehensive assay design and development guidelines for quantitive and qualitative 
real-time assays should be provided to enable designing of custom oligo assays.
