System 
 User Programmable Settings 
o 40 user defined protocols and 3 operating modes 
(Denaturation/Hybridization, Hybridization, and Fixed 
Temperature) 
o Numeric keypad allows for easy programming 
o Can be used as a fixed temperature slide warmer. 
 
 Easy to use 
o Eliminates manual steps and reduces hands-on time 
during (F)ISH procedures 
o Slides do not need to be fully loaded to maintain 
temperature accuracy 
o Slide guide keeps slides in place and allows for one 
hand removal 
 
 More stringent temperature control 
o Temperature ramp-up with accuracy of ± 1° C 
o Superior temperature uniformity across all slide 
positions 
o Optimal humidity control 
o Heats slide to temperatures ideal for FISH procedures 
 
 Bench-top Model 
 Should be able to hold more than 10 slides at one time.  
 Should have user friendly programmable setting for processing 
time and temperature 
 Power conditions – as per Indian conditions 
 Suitable Stabilizer (minimum 2kVa) should be supplied along 
with the Power Unit. 
 WARRANTY: 5 Years Comprehensive including the spares 
 PENALTY CLAUSE: In no case instrument should remain not
