Fully Automatic & Compact Langendorff system 
Technical Specifications 
 
Fully automated, Compact profile system with constantly oxygenated and temperature controlled unit that 
includes two perfusate chambers, heart chamber, heated junction block and a thermostat controller. It should 
allow heart perfusion form rat, mouse, rabbit and guinea pig hearts. (Qty 1) 
 
The pump controller should control the peristaltic pump by providing an analog output corresponding to 
calibrated flow rates. And constant pressure/flow feedback system to the peristaltic pump (Qty 1) 
 
The system should work on Constant flow and Constant Pressure modes. A simple switch should allow 
switching between both the modes. 
 
It should not have any elevated reservoirs to maintain the pressures Instead it should have a peristaltic pump 
along with using a pump controller to be connected with the software. (Qty 1) 
 
Parameters measured: - Coronary Vessel Function, Left Ventricular pressure/Developed pressure/Systolic 
and diastolic pressure, Left Ventricular dP/dt maximum and minimum, perfusate temperature, perfusion 
pressure, perfusion flow, Cardiac electrical activity and Monophasic action potentials, coronary flow and 
heart rate. 
 
A High speed USB based Eight Channel DAS with Max Sampling speed 400KHz, ADC 16 Bits. Along with 
Analysis Software that tabulates the results automatically or generate instantaneous Hill Curves, displays 
single or multiple dose response curves, calculates EC50 and Hill slopes. Along with HRV, ECG, PEAK 
Analysis. 
 
It should allow 32 channels of real time analyses along with user to export in file formats like binary, Axon 
allow, IGOR, MATLAB, Excel, Graph Pad prism, Quick time, Wav, Text Etc. (Qty1) 
 
The System should have independent stimulator outputs with output resolution of 16 bits and software 
provides Pulse, step Ramp, wave etc. waveforms stimulus generating options. Have an option for Electrical 
pacing of isolated Heart (Qty1) 
 
The Software controlled amplifier should support software automated zeroing of the offset. It should allow 
simple two-point calibration and multi point calibration for highly accurate studies. To be supplied with 
compatible pressure transducers. (Qty2). 
Latex Balloon (at least 20) along with LVP Catheter. (Qty 1) 
 
Isometric Transducer Should be provided with a range (0-50gms). (Qty 1) 
 
Should be supplied with pH amplifier along with pH electrode. (Qty 1) 


along with compatible crocodile and spring clip electrodes (Qty 1) 
 
Software selectable High pass filters: - 0.1,0.3, 1,3 & 10Hz along with user define digital filters. 
 
Software Controlled temperature preamplifier along and T-Type Thermocouple with an operating range: -
273 to 150 Celsius & accuracy of -+ 0.1 Celsius for monitor Perfusate Temperature. (Qty 1) 
 
The software should have a free update & upgrades for a period of 5yrs. 
 
Free file sharing facility with distinct user free of cost. 
 
Manufacturer must be ISO 9001:2008 or latest Certified Company & company with safety standards.
