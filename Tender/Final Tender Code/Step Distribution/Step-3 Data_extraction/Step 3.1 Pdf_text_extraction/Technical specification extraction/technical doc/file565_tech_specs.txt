(Anoxomat) 
Automated 
Anaerobic 
Jar System  
1. Equipment, on full up gradation, should be efficient enough to produce 
any gas atmosphere (other than hazardous and inflammable in 
transparent jars, by programming, required O2 (atmospheric), CO2, H2 
& N2 (from cylinders of mix gases & pure gases except H2) 
percentages, through touch screen and having enough memory to store 
multiple Recipe (more than 30) for future use, with reproducibility of > 
0.5% deviations. 
2. It should be fully automatic so that the user attends other work while it 
processes the jar, should be able to eliminate human error. 
3. It should have touch screen display for simple operation. 
4. The equipment should be  upgradeable so that the basic equipment can 
be upgraded to model having facility to accommodate 3 gases or jars, if 
required 
5. Its quality assurance features can identify defective jars, catalyst and 
nonavailability of gases, before incubation. 
6. All controlled conditions like Hypoxia, Capnohilic, anaerobic & 
Microaerophilic can be reproducible to stay within 0.5% of the desired 
value. 
7. It should be fast enough to produce any environment conditions in 360 
seconds. 
8. It should have provision to fix filter to prevent microbial contamination 
of the laboratory environment. In case user order for it. 
9. It should be flexible enough so that a programmable model should be 
able to produce optimal conditions for each strain or cells in separate 
jars. 
10. It should works without any disposable and chemicals. 
11. It should keep its jar atmosphere with appropriate humidity to prevent 
drying and cross contaminations. 
12. The equipment should cost efficient due to minimum consumption of 
gases & low maintenance. 
13. It should work with transparent anaerobic jars of its own and with 
modified ordinary anaerobic jars having no leakages. 
14. It should be a tabletop model with small footprint. 
15. The instrument should work at 110-220 V electric power with 110-20 V 
To 220-240 V voltage. Frequency should be 50-60 Hz with power 
consumption 516 Watt. Instrument weight should be 14.5 Kg, with 
Height 13 in, Depth 9 in, width 12 in. It should be operated at 
temperature 500-910F, with relative humidity 20-80%. 
16. It should be ordered to come with its own printer (GLP Guideline) 
connection for LAN & barcode scanning of specimens (quote as 
optional). 
17. Vacuum pump should be incorporated to the body of equipment. 
18. The equipment should come with arrangements for supply of Indian 
items like gas cylinders, pressure regulators. 
19. The equipment should supplied with arrangement for free gas supply for 
2 (two) years. 
20. After Sale, Service should be available promptly.  
21.  Should be CE or FDA or BIS approved product
