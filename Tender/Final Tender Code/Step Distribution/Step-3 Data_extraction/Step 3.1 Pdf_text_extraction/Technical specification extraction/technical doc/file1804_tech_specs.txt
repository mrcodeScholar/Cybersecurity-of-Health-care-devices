3. Technical Bid (Specification):  
 
Name of the E-Tender: Supply, Installation & Commissioning of Repetitive 
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulator (RTMS) at AIIMS, Bhubaneswar. 
 
3.1 Schedule of Requirements: 
 
The institute requires 01 Nos. of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulator (RTMS) to be 
used by the Department of Psychiatry. The equipment is/are to be delivered within 90 days 
from placing of Purchase Order at the Central Store of AIIMS Bhubaneswar at the quoted/ 
negotiated price without any additional cost to the institute as per specifications given 
below. 
 Specification of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulator (RTMS): 
Sl

Remarks 
Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulator (RTMS), Make-                              Model-     
1 
The system should be able to deliver the following waveforms and 
pulses through a single unit- 
a) Biphasic 
b) Biphasic Burst 
c) Monophasic 
d) Theta Burst 
e) Quadri-pulse (biphasic and monophasic pulses) 
 
 
2 
System should be able to deliver Single, Paired, Half sine, Twin and 
Dual pulses through the same unit. 
 
 
3 
It should be able to provide a repetitive pulse of frequency from 1 
to 100 Hz: Same device should also be upgradeable to 250 Hz. 
 
 
4 
The system should have up to 4 Tesla peak magnetic fields at 
100% output at 25 Hz without the need of additional units. 
 
 
5 
It should have the possibility of providing three (3) minutes per 
session of theta burst stimulation with advanced burst sequencing. 
 
 
6 
It should be able to perform ITBS and CTBS protocols in 30 Hz or 50 
Hz. 
 
 
7 
Stimulator should have the feature of electronically selecting the 
current direction from normal or reverse without changing the coil 
position. 
 
 
8 
The stimulator should be upgradable for interleaved TMS/MRI 
study. 
 
 
9 
It should have options to block/unblock amplitude to prevent 
unintentional adjustment of protocol setting and amplitude output 
during running trains.  
 
 
10 
It should be supplied with a 2ch MEP module to check for motor 
threshold detection. It should be supplied with a therapeutic 
software with the facility of assessing motor threshold detection, 
MEP, SICI, LICI etc. 
 
 
11 
The machine should be supplied with the static/dynamic liquid 
cooling system with the coil provided as 
a) One liquid cooled angulated figure of eight coil 
FDA/CE Stimulation capacity of at least 5500 pulses. 
b) One Cooled Big ring coil.

c) One Sham Coil. 
12 
Coils should have a sensor built into measure the Realized display 
of the actual current gradient in di/dt (A/us) value, should display it 
on the stimulator and not just a calculated value. 
 
 
  13 
Cooled coils should be able to show the number of remaining 
stimuli within the coil to determine the lifespan of the coil.  
 
 
14 
The system should stop stimulation if the cod heats up to 41-
degree temperature. 
 
 
15 
It should be supplied with a 360-degree rotation coil stand and a 
comfortable patient chair. 
 
 
16 
The system should be supplied with a desktop/Laptop (15 
Processors, 8GB RAM, 1 TB SDD) for operating the magnetic 
stimulator along with Therapeutic Software. 
 
 
17 
There should be inbuilt software to provide different treatment 
protocols (Including FDA-Certified protocols) with the option of 
editing them or creating new protocols. 
 
 
18 
The stimulator must be US FDA/CE/BIS Certified. 
 
 
19 
The existing stimulator should be upgradeable with any neuro-
navigation system. 
 
 
20 
The system should have a trigger in/out facility to connect to a 
third-party system. 
 
 
21 
Physical demonstration is compulsory during the technical 
evaluation. 
 
 
22 
System must have a warranty of 5 years & CAMC for Five Years 
after completion of the warranty. 
 
 
23 
Bidders should provide price list of all types of coils and other 
accessories and consumables & spare parts that should be valid for 
the warranty and CAMC period. If the price of any stem is not 
quoted in the price list, firm has to provide the item free of cost for 
the life of the equipment (Warranty + CAMC). 
 
 
24 
The firm must ensure to provide quality post sale service with 95% 
uptime of the equipment per year. In case downtime exceeds 5% in 
a calendar year, a penalty of 5% of the total cost of the tender shall 
be levied. 
 
 
25 
The response time to a complaint should not be more than 48 
hours. Delay beyond 48 hours shall invite a penalty of 0.1% for the 
1 week, which shall be doubled by the passage of every week (i.e. 
0.2% in 2 weeks, 0.4% in 3 weeks, 0.8% in 4 week and so on).
