Multichannel Micropipette  
Multichannel pipettes are especially important when dispensing long 
series for example in rows of tubes or in 96-well/384-well plates 
(MTP). And it is for this environment that we developed the Research® 
(multi-channel), which can be operated with a single hand only. This 
high-performance 8- or 12-channel pipette is an effective, precise and 
rapid way of processing long series for a whole spectrum of different 
applications.
