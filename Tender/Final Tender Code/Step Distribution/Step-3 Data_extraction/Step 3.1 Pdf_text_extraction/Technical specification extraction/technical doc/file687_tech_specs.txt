TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION 
“NIV/BI – LEVEL VENTILATOR (BIPAP MACHINE) ” 
         FOR DEPARTMENT OF PULMONARY MEDICINE 
 
 
1. Non Invasive Ventilator having invasive application capabilities for Adult and 
Paediatricusage (above 15 Kgs). 
 
2. It should be a light & compact device combining unique latest NIV features with 
simplicity in use. 
 
3. Modes of Ventilation: S/T (Spontaneous/Timed), PAC (Pressure Assisted Control), 
CPAP(Continuous Positive Airway Pressure), S(Spontaneous), T (Timed), Volume 
Assured Pressure Support (to ensure Alveolar ventilation). 
 
4. Should incorporate latest algorithms for leak compensation and synchronization. 
Both should work together to provide control and flexibility to improve 
ventilation, comfort and sleep; better disease management, increased patient 
comfort and therapy acceptance (patient’s breathing ‘in sync’ with their device. 
 
5. It should have colour screen for real-time monitoring to provide essential 
information including simultaneously viewed flow and pressure curves, the Ti-bar 
graph to fine-tune ventilation, and SpO2 and FiO2 monitoring. 
 
6. The machine should have a choice of disease-specific preset values Defaults (for 
obstructive, restrictive, normal lung mechanics and obesity hypoventilation) 
based on commonly used clinical values to help the users for optimising settings  
 
7. Should have built in internal battery for minimum 2 hours of back up time. 
 
8. Should include user adjustable alarms and essential non-adjustable, fixed 
alarms for patient safety  
 
9. Should have oxygen inlet port to accept higher flow up to 30 L/min of oxygen to 
achieve a highFiO2 with built in FiO2 monitoring  
 
10. Data download capability – The usage and summary data for up to 365 treatment 
sessions and seven days of high resolution, breath-by-breath data (including 
SpO2 and FiO2) should be  stored in the device; data can be downloaded via USB 
or cable, using a data management PC application. 
 
11. It should also provide patient reminders, such as filter and mask replacements. 
 
12. The NIV should comply with following technical specifications  
Pressure range 
:  
IPAP: 2–40 cm H2O&EPAP: 2–25 cm H2O
