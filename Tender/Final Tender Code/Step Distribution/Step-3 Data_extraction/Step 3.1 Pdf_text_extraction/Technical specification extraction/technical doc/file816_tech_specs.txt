ANNEXURE-I 
Technical Specification for Real Time Quantitative PCR System 
1. The system should be capable of performing both real time PCR and end point 
analysis. 
2. The system should be peltier-based system. 
3. There should be 96-well block instrument (both for Fast and standard Emulation 
Mode). 
4. Should have Reaction volume of 10-100 μL and should use Universal thermal cycling 
conditions. 
5. Reaction should be run in the form of plate, individual tube and tube strips. 
6. The System should be combined with 6 decoupled excitation and emission filter sets 
to enable collection of 21 unique combinations of wavelengths during a single run for 
multiplexing on the 96-well block instrument. 
7. The excitation should be done by White LED light source & should come with a >05 
years lifespan and detection should be done by sCMOS / CCD. 
8. The system should have block ramp rate (at peak) of ≥ 6.5° C. 
9. Temperature Range: 4°C-99.9°C. 
10. Should have Dynamic range up to 10 orders of Magnitude. 
11. Should have six independent Peltier Block to provide six independent temperature 
zones to run six different assays with varying annealing temperature at the same 
time. Each block having the ability to set up PCR with specific temperature 
differential of up to 5 degree centigrade between blocks and 25 Deg. from one end to 
another. 
12. Should be factory calibrated for handling all commonly used fluorescent dyes such 
as (SYBER GREEN, FAM,VIC,ABY, NED, JUN, TAMRA, ROX, Mustang Purple and Cy5 
dyes, Cy3, and calibrated any other dyes in the wavelength of 450-730nm should be 
possible without any filters set and applications for diagnosis of human infectious 
diseases. The dyes which are those used for RT PCR application generally require 
emission and excitation range in between 450-730nm, not below this range.) QUSAR 
670/705 is equivalent to TAMRA and Mustang Purple no need to calibrate it. 
13. Calibration for new dyes within the wavelength range should be possible without 
purchase of additional filters sets. 
14. The system should be capable of performing relative and absolute quantitation, 
melting curve analysis (at high resolution), multiplex-PCR, SNP analysis, dissociation 
curve analysis, pathogen detection and plus/minus assays etc. 
15. The system should be able to collect data for all 5 filters for all wells regardless of 
plate setup. Plate setup may be altered after run completes.

16. The quoted system will provide details of data acquisition during run for all dyes and 
ensured. 
Temperature 
accuracy: Maximum 
(+/-0.25°C of set 
point/display 
temperature, measured at 1 minute after clock start). 
17. Run Time of quoted system ~30 min (fast mode-expert), <1.5 hrs (Standard for 40 
cycles). 
18. The instrument should include a heated lid assembly that heats the top half of the 
sample plates and provides an effective seal to minimize reaction mixture evaporation. 
19. System should collect data for all filters, for all wells regardless of plate setup. 
20. It should be possible to alter the plate setup after the completion of run. 
21. The software should be inclusive of Multi-componenting algorithm designed to 
provide precise deconvolution of multiple dye signals in each well to ensure minimal 
crosstalk when using multiple fluorophores for multiplex assays. 
22. The system should be supplied with dedicated licensed full version software for 
primer and probe design with comprehensive assay design and development 
guidelines for quantitative and qualitative real-time assays to enable designing of 
custom oligo assays. 
23. Electrical specification: 220 volts, 50Hz. single phase A.C. 
24. System should be an open platform enabling use of various chemistries without 
hardware change. 
25. Should provide yearly calibration certificate including temperature calibration 
verification test, temperature non-uniformity test and performance diagnostic test 
within warranty as well as in CMC. 
26. System should be CE-IVD or FDA or BIS approved product for in vitro diagnostics. 
27. Branded Online UPS of 3KVA for one hour backup for the duration of one cycle of 
processing to be provided. 
28. The calibration, IQ, OQ and PQ of the instrument should be performed at the time of 
installation and certificates should be provided.
