11. Should have Dynamic range up to 10 orders of Magnitude. 
12. Should have six independent Peltier Block to provide six independent 
temperature zones to run six different assays with varying annealing 
temperature at the same time. Each block having the ability to set up PCR with 
specific temperature differential of up to 5 degree centigrade between blocks and 
25 Deg. from one end to another.   
13. The system should be factory calibrated for handling dyes such as SYBR Green, 
FAM, VIC, JOE, NED, TAMRA, ROX, Texas Red, Cy3, Cy5. 
14. Calibration for new dyes within the wavelength range should be possible by 
following the custom dye calibration procedure in the User’s Manual without 
purchase of additional filter sets. 
15. The system should be capable of performing relative and absolute quantitation, 
melting curve analysis (at high resolution), multiplex-PCR, SNP analysis, 
dissociation curve analysis, pathogen detection and plus/minus assays etc. 
16. The system should be able to collect data for all 5 filters for all wells regardless 
of plate setup. Plate setup may be altered after run completes. 
17. Details of data acquisition during run for all dyes should be provided and 
ensured. Temperature accuracy should be maximum (+/-0.5°C of set 
point/display temperature, measured at 3 minutes after clock start).
